# Contributing
So, you want to contribute to the project? Welcome!

Since this is an open source project, I would love to have your feedback! If you are interested, I would also love to
have your help! Whether it is fixing typos, fleshing out the content more, etc. -- everything helps.

I have a few requests for those that are interested in contributing and have outlined them below.

## The Basics
This project uses the "GitHub" branching model. If you would like to read more on some of the various branching models,
the two big ElePHPants in the room are the [GitHub Flow](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html) and the
[Gitflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) branching model.

## <a name="bug-reports"></a>Bug Reports
When the inevitable happens and you discover a bug in the documentation or the code, please follow the process below to
help me out.

* Search the existing issues to see if the issue has already been filed
* Make sure the issue is a bug and not simply a preference
* If you have found a new issue, please file it

From that point, if you are interested in contributing some code, ask in the issue if I am willing to accept a fix.
If I am, then follow the steps for contributing and we can go from there!

## <a name="feature-requests"></a>Feature Requests
Every new feature request will be scrutinized to make sure the site is not going to experience feature bloat. Every new
feature should fit the Vision for the project. If you have an idea for a new feature and feel it fits the vision, file
an issue and we can discuss it.

Make sure any feature request you make fits the [INVEST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INVEST_(mnemonic)) mnemonic.

## <a name="pull-requests"></a>Pull Requests
A well written pull request is a huge piece of the success of any open source project. Please make sure to take the
time to think out the request and document/comment well. A good pull request should be the smallest successful
feature, akin to the [INVEST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INVEST_(mnemonic)) mnemonic used in scrum.

Make sure if you have a related issue / feature request for your Pull Request and note in the PulL Request description.
Most of the time as long as you are following the project vision, I'll welcome additions.

Also, make sure your pull request is built with a compilation of great
[commit messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).

The [Bower](https://github.com/bower/bower/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) project has awesome instructions for Pull
Requests, I have added a copy here.

Adhering to the following this process is the best way to get your work included in the project:

1. [Fork](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) the project, clone your fork, and configure the remotes:

   ```bash
   # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/AnimeNewsNetworkDataAPI
   # Navigate to the newly cloned directory
   cd AnimeNewsNetworkDataAPI
   # Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/sprak3000/AnimeNewsNetworkDataAPI
   ```

2. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:

   ```bash
   git checkout master
   git pull upstream master
   ```

3. Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) to
   contain your feature, change, or fix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
   ```

4. Commit your changes in logical chunks. Please adhere to these [git commit
   message guidelines](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
   or your code is unlikely be merged into the main project. Use Git's
   [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase)
   feature to tidy up your commits before making them public.

5. Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch:

   ```bash
   git pull [--rebase] upstream master
   ```

6. Push your topic branch up to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin <topic-branch-name>
   ```

7. [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
    with a clear title and description.

8. If you are asked to amend your changes before they can be merged in, please
   use `git commit --amend` (or rebasing for multi-commit Pull Requests) and
   force push to your remote feature branch. You may also be asked to squash
   commits.

**IMPORTANT**: By submitting a patch, you agree to license your work under the same license as that used by the project.
