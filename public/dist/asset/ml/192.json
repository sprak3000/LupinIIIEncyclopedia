But only at the first time it was \r\nbroadcasted..... some year later the serie was redubbed, cutted in the \r\nsex-violence scenes and Planet O was replaced by a really bad italian song \r\n\"Lupin, l'incorreggibile Lupin\"\r\n\r\n>  I wonder what the 'Planet O'\r\n>reference is for?  Or was it not ever revealed?  The song is good. I've\r\n>maanged to download an mp3 of it and it's b-side.  Very disco :)  The lyrics\r\n>are really bizarre (\"I'm a lady, just a baby\/ what no lady?  What no\r\n>baby?\").  was the song made by an Italian group or a japanese one?\r\n\r\nImho the song have no reference to Lupin, and was taken maybe only to \r\npromote the record. I think it's english or american. Just another oddity \r\nin the history of the anime in Italy!","message_date":"February 12 2002 7:53 AM"}
