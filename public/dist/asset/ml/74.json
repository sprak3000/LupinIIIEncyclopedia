Larry is a (insult deleted).\r\nI can't believe he even asked if he could run my\r\nwebpage for the next 2 years, did he think I didn't\r\nknow how big a moron he was? Oh, wasn't he also the\r\none who claimed he'd been hired (by USPS mail, mind\r\nyou) as \"key grip\" for a Hollywood Lupin film? Also, I\r\njust realized why my inbox was full of pure Luis\r\nletters.... Larry is on my \"block\" list, teehee.\r\nWhatever... On with the show.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of AnimEigo and DVD, I think it was awesome\r\nof M2K to rerelease BGC on a new, repaired 4-disc set,\r\nand even allow for a trade-in of your old BGC 3-disc\r\nset, at a mere $30+shipping! Plus, the remakes have\r\nall old BGC problems tidied up. It's just sugoi! I\r\nhope Lupin\/Rupan gets a 2-disc package release, or\r\nsomething like that.. with a new dub for \"Babylon\"\r\n(preferrably with a new cast than \"Fuma\"...)\r\n\r\nAlso, it's a bit of a shame that AnimEigo did not\r\npress extra sets for later purchase, did they mention\r\nany chance of being able to purchase them some other\r\nway in the future? You see, I've never seen Urusei\r\nYatsura, and I might be interested in getting some\r\n(the only UY I've seen is Movie 2: Beautiful Dreamer).\r\nThank you for your time.\r\nEnjoy your inbox Larry....bwahahahahahahaaaa!\r\n\r\n\r\n=====\r\n\"Arsene Lupin III\"\r\nwebmaster@lupinthethird.nospam.com\r\n(Remove \"nospam\" to reply)\r\nhttp:\/\/www.LupintheThird.com\r\n\r\n__________________________________________________\r\nDo You Yahoo!?\r\nYahoo!
