I haven't contacted them in a LONG time though.\r\n\r\nThanks for the input.  I haven't heard of any output from them in more than \r\na year, although that doesn't preclude behind the scenes work for others in \r\ntranslation, timing, etc.  Also notable, but probably unreleated is that one \r\nof Neko's main distributers, ChiAnime, has also closed up shop.\r\n\r\nCuriously, I've been able to find one distro that appears to list the \r\nremainder of the First TV Series as being available subtitled:\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/fansubnation.animebb.net\/\r\n\r\nHas anyone dealt with these guys?  My question to them as to wether it was \r\nthe first Lupin series met with a response of 'the site has all the \r\ninformation you want', which really isn't the case at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nRob S.\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________________\r\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http:\/\/www.hotmail.com.\r\n","message_date":"June 12 2001 12:26 PM"}
