Apart from three Lupin songs (Lupin the Third: Ending Theme\r\n(Original title: Lupin Sansei Shudaika 2), Lupin the Third: Theme of\r\nWalther P38 (Original title: Afro Lupin '68) and a second version of the\r\nEnding Theme) which make it a great addition to the Punch the Monkey\r\nremix and cover CD's, but a mind-blowing version of the Giant Robot\r\n(which graces the cover) theme and lots more anime themes.  You can find\r\nthe full track listing in English at \r\nhttp:\/\/www2.gol.com\/users\/miyu...dies\/pvine\/takeoyamashita.html\r\nI think there may be another Lupin theme but I don't recognize the title\r\n- Bokensha-tachi no Ballad.  Ring any bells?\r\nDingle\r\n","message_date":"January 12 2000 4:25 PM"}
