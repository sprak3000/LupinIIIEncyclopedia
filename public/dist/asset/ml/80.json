{"id":"80","author":"DANIEL ZELTER","subject":"LGA News and Assistance","body":"LGA updated today with more news on their Lupin fansubbing progress. 1)\"Lupin '95 = done, but... Gary is looking for some sponsors now that he's fulfilled his Mellowlink obligation. If you are interested in helping us recoup some of the money he spent having it translated (which in turn makes it easier to have new things translated), contact Gary.\" (Now I don't know which 95 movie they're referring to, because it could be Nostradamus or Harimao.)\r\n\r\n2) \"More LGA-Gary WIP: (WIP = Works in Progress) Lupin III 2nd series episodes 69, 71, 148, and 151 are well on their way... 69 and 71 are totally done but the other two need a bit of work yet. Also, Gary has gotten a Lupin special box set, and has begun work on making a fresh new version of the '93 special. Also, I believe we are still waiting for the retranslation of the '99 Lupin special.\"\r\n\r\n3)\" Gary has recently gotten a DVD player and is interested in getting the Y2K special, which isn't coming out on LD, but needs some advice on how to play import disks on a domestic player... region lockout fucking sucks, to put it bluntly.\"\r\n\r\nSo if anyone wants to see One Dollar Money Wars, and can help LGA with their dilemma, go to their url at http:\/\/www.pond.com\/~erik\/lupingang\/  .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http:\/\/explorer.msn.com\r\n","message_date":"January 1 2001 7:17 PM"}
