{"id":"168","author":"Monsieur B","subject":"Re: DVD - 1st Series Lupin the 3rd Questions","body":"Hi Conrad!\r\n\r\nI bought myself the 1st series on DVD this summer.\r\nIt was just released by Yamato Video in Italy.\r\n\r\nStrange thing is that the DVDs don't have any\r\nsubtitling... They come with 3 audio tracks, being\r\nJapanese and Italian (original dub and new dub).\r\nSince I speak Italain, it's not much of a problem for\r\nme... but clearly, this is not for everybody !\r\n\r\nYou can order the 5 DVDs from Yamato Video web site on\r\nhttp:\/\/www.yamatovideo.com\/temporaneo\/index.html\r\nThey are about 50 000 Lit each which brings you to a\r\nbig total of 250 000 Lit (!) around $115 US for those\r\nwho wonder - and you'll agree this is not expensive at\r\nall for 5 DVDs !\r\n\r\n+ I believe they have a psecial offer if you order\r\nthem all at once (something like free shipping).\r\n\r\nAs for the quality - this is going to sound very\r\nstupid - I haven't had the time to go through all of\r\nthem yet.\r\nThe DVD boxes are just perfect with new art and a\r\ndouble page booklet in every DVD presenting the Lupin\r\nsaga (how they did the series, with who and why it\r\ndidn't work out at first...)\r\n\r\nAs for the animation, the image is clean (i should say\r\nVERY clean), the audio is a beautiful italian dub like\r\nthe ones I've grown up with :)...\r\nThat's the best I can do right now !\r\nIf you need more info, ask and I'll do what I can !\r\n\r\nMr B.\r\n\r\nPS : about the 2nd series, \r\n\r\n__________________________________________________\r\nDo You Yahoo!?\r\nYahoo!
