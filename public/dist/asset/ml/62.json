{"id":"62","author":"Frank Corrieri","subject":"Kiwi","body":"Lupin fans:\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for Lupin movies or episodes, check out Kiwi's Independent \r\nDistribution Service (http:\/\/www.jps.net\/kaskey\/KIDS\/).  They have a few \r\nLupin movies and episodes, but it's the most I've been able to find \r\nanywhere, since a lot of hobby stores carry the same stock, like Castle \r\nCagliostro and Aloha Lupin...etc.  Best of all, they're cheap.  I bought 5 \r\nmovies and 4 episodes for $36.  This may sound like an advertisement, but I \r\ndon't work for them! I found them through hunting around and thought I would \r\nshare them with Lupin fans everywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n>From: \"Mariana A Corda\" <mcorda@ciudad.com.ar>\r\n>Reply-To: lupin@mcs.kent.edu\r\n>To: <lupin@mcs.kent.edu>\r\n>Subject: Re: [lupin] lupin theme\r\n>Date: Wed, 11 Oct 2000 21:12:58 -0300\r\n>MIME-Version: 1.0\r\n>Received: from [131.123.2.144] by hotmail.com (3.2) with ESMTP id \r\n>MHotMailBBAE537900A7D820F3BB837B029005700; Wed Oct 11 17:40:38 2000\r\n>Received: (from mdomo@localhost)by info.mcs.kent.edu \r\n>(8.10.0.Beta10\/8.10.0.Beta10) id e9C0EOd00223for lupin-list; Wed, 11 Oct \r\n>2000 20:14:24 -0400 (EDT)\r\n>Received: from ns.mcs.kent.edu (root@mcs.kent.edu [131.123.2.130])by \r\n>info.mcs.kent.edu (8.10.0.Beta10\/8.10.0.Beta10) with ESMTP id \r\n>e9C0E4V00214for <lupin@info.mcs.kent.edu>; Wed, 11 Oct 2000 20:14:10 -0400 \r\n>(EDT)\r\n>Received: from postino4.prima.com.ar (postino4.prima.com.ar \r\n>[200.42.0.162])by ns.mcs.kent.edu (8.10.0.Beta10\/8.10.0.Beta10) with ESMTP \r\n>id e9C0DrZ07171for <lupin@mcs.kent.edu>; Wed, 11 Oct 2000 20:14:00 -0400 \r\n>(EDT)\r\n>Received: from sitenshi (a200042102242.rev.prima.com.ar [200.42.102.242])by \r\n>postino4.prima.com.ar (8.9.3\/8.9.1) with SMTP id VAA10225for \r\n><lupin@mcs.kent.edu>; Wed, 11 Oct 2000 21:13:28 -0300 (ART)\r\n>From owner-lupin@mcs.kent.edu Wed Oct 11 17:45:22 2000\r\n>X-Authentication-Warning: info.mcs.kent.edu: mdomo set sender to \r\n>owner-lupin@mcs.kent.edu using -f\r\n>Message-ID: <001001c033e1$2f146da0$f2662ac8@sitenshi>\r\n>References: <Pine.LNX.4.10.10010101852070.11806-100000@atenea.pucp.edu.pe>\r\n>X-Priority: 3\r\n>X-MSMail-Priority: Normal\r\n>X-Mailer: Microsoft Outlook Express 5.50.4133.2400\r\n>X-MimeOLE: Produced By Microsoft MimeOLE V5.50.4133.2400\r\n>Sender: owner-lupin@mcs.kent.edu\r\n>Precedence: bulk\r\n>\r\n> > Yes, Aramis (I think he's Arsene in Japanese version or Cliff in\r\n> > English one) the wise Aramis Lupin, and Julian, I guess he is Zenigata \r\n>or\r\n> > something like that... but the one i like the best is Vanessa (Fujiko) \r\n>*_*\r\n>\r\n>Hi, I'm Mariana from Argentina, and I wanted to know the time they show\r\n>Lupin on Locomotion, (I think I'm getting it next month!!!!).\r\n>My fav character is Jigen (Julian, the guy with the black hat and suit).\r\n>Next Arsene Lupin (Aramis) and Goemon (Ramon) , 3rd Zenigata (the police\r\n>inspector) and finally Fujiko.
