{"id":"204","author":"Arsene Lupin III","subject":"\"Lupin in English FAQ\" commentary.","body":"\r\n> 1978 Mystery of Mamo\/Secret of  Mamo\/Lupin vs the\r\n> Clone\/Lupin vs Kuron\/Lupin vs the Immortal Man \r\n> (Lupin nei Fukusei Ningen\/Mamoo no Ichihen ) \r\n> - originally titled \"Lupin III\" when released in\r\n> Japan, the later titles were added to avoid\r\n> confusion with subsequent films.  \r\n\r\nPretty much accurate here, but there's only one person\r\nwho I know that calls it \"Lupin vs. Kuron,\" and that's\r\nValerie, a former list regular. A Neko fansub of\r\n\"Secret Files\" called it \"Lupin vs. Kuron,\" without\r\nrelaizing \"Kuron\" was katakana for the English word\r\n\"Clone.\" I have seen Japanese web pages call the film\r\n\"Lupin tei Fukusei-Ningen <Kuron>,\" or in English:\r\n\"Lupin vs. The Immortal Men <Clones>.\" \r\nSo the film, in Japan, has 2 titles:\r\n\"Lupin vs. The Immortal Men\/Lupin vs. The Clones\"\r\nor\r\n\"Lupin the Third.\"\r\nIn English, 2 titles:\r\n(UK Dub): \"The Secret of Mamo\"\r\n(US Dub): \"The Mystery of Mamo\"\r\n\r\nI have no idea where the title \"Mamo's First Copy\"\r\n(Mamoh no Ichihen\" came into play. I would go ahead\r\nand leave it in though, just for the 'halibut.'\r\n\r\n> SUB Any *english* fansubbed versions of this exist?\r\n> (I know of a Finnish sub)\r\n> INP Lupin Gang Anime (on hold)\r\n\r\nI think all the fansubbers just decided to wait it out\r\nand see if anyone besides Streamline would touch it.\r\nOr they simply couldn't get a steady translator to do\r\nit (LGA falls into that category). If you want an\r\naccurate translation of the film, I would suggest\r\nviewing the TMS dub from a few years back, and ignore\r\nthe weird name changes.\r\n \r\n> 1979 The Castle of Cagliostro (Cariosutoro no shiro)\r\n> SUB\/DUB Manga Ent. VHS\/DVD (Region 1), sub script by\r\n> Neil Nadelman\r\n> SUB\/DUB Buena Vista Home Ent. DVD (Region 2), uses\r\n> Streamline dub and Carl Macek's english script for\r\n> subtitles (dubtitle)\r\n> DUB Streamline Ent. VHS (OOP), Toho dual language LD\r\n> (OOP) \r\n> SUB many fansubs exist from public scripts, most are\r\n> now redundant to the commercial Manga sub.\r\n\r\nAh, but there were 2 *theatrical* English subs of\r\nCagliostro. One was released in limited quantity by\r\nStreamline Pictures in 1991. It was very accurate,\r\nbesides Lupin being called \"Wolf.\" \r\nThere was also another one made years before\r\n(presumably by TMS Japan), using an original sub\r\nscript. The names were changed (except Lupin's, I\r\nwould guess) much like they were for the TMS dub of\r\nMamo... e.x.: \"Detective Scott\" instead of \"Inspector\r\nZenigata.\" The Streamline theatrical sub was likely\r\nbased on the translation used in this release.\r\n\r\n> 1982 Lupin VIII\/Arsene and Company\/Arsene et cie \r\n> - pilot film of a series (Japan and France\r\n> coproduction, and possibly DIC in Canada?) aborted\r\n> due to copyright issues between Leblanc estate and\r\n> TMS.\r\n> INP ??? Pilot exists without vocal track which may\r\n> have never been recorded. \r\n\r\nYeah I read an interview that said a bit about Lupin\r\nthe Eighth (thanks Ryu!). It was a French\r\nCo-production with Japan (it's been done before), and\r\nDiC had a hand in it too. I think DiC was more\r\ndirectly connected to the French end of the deal than\r\nJapan.\r\nOn a side note, there were actually 6 episodes\r\ncompleted before they cancelled the series due to the\r\nLeBlanc name (it was no going to be public domain\r\nuntil 1991 and the \"Lupin VIII\" series was being made\r\nin 1980-1981), but only the premiere is floating\r\naround....\r\n\r\n> 1984 Lupin III Part 3 (TV Series, 50 episodes)\r\n> SUB Lupin Gang Anime ep 2, 6, 9, 17\r\n> \r\n> 1985 Legend of Gold Babylon\/Golden Legend of Babylon\r\n> (Babiron no Ogon Densetzu)\r\n> SUB AnimEigo VHS\/LD as \"Rupan III\"\r\n\r\nThe way it's written, it should be \"Golden Legend of\r\nBabylon\" or even simply \"Gold Legend of Babylon.\"\r\nAnimEigo rearranged the words and added an \"of,\" and\r\nin doing so, altered its literal meaning a tiny bit:\r\n\"Legend of the Gold of Babylon.\"\r\n\r\n> 1987 The Fuma Conspiracy\/Plot of the Fuma Clan\r\n> (Fuuma Ichizoku no Imboo)\r\n> SUB\/DUB AnimEigo VHS\/LD as \"Rupan III\"\r\n> SUB ???\r\n\r\nThe AnimEigo LD was not available dubbed. So I would\r\nwrite it:\r\nSUB\/DUB AnimEigo VHS as \"Rupan III\"\r\nSUB Animeigo LD as \"Rupan III\"\r\n\r\nThere were fansubs of this made, but I don't know any\r\nsubber names. It was the source of the English title\r\n\"Plot of the Fuma Clan,\" a more accurate translation\r\nthan \"The Fuma Conspiracy,\" though I admit\r\n\"conspiracy\" is a pretty cool word. You can find a\r\nsubtitle script for it online.\r\n\r\n> 1989 Goodbye Lady Liberty\/Bye Bye Liberty Crisis -\r\n> Begin Emergency! (Bai Bai Ribatii - Kiki Ippatsu!)\r\n> DUB Manga Ent UK VHS (PAL TV format only)\r\n> SUB Studio Banzai\r\n> SUB Nippon Golden Network (Hawaiian TV\/KHML)\/J.N.\r\n> Productions\r\n\r\nIt's either \"Bye Bye Liberty-Begin Emergency!\" or \"Bye\r\nBye Liberty Crisis.\" Not a combination of the 2. ;-)\r\n\r\n> 1994 Mighty Sword that Cuts Steel\/Zentesu Sword is\r\n> on Fire (Moeyo Zantetsuken)\r\n> SUB Odyssey Anime (v1)\r\n> SUB S. Baldric productions (bootleg?)\r\n\r\nThe reason I called them bootleggers on my site is\r\nbecause Fansubs.net called them bootleggers. I can't\r\nsay personally because I never dealt directly with\r\nthem.\r\n \r\n> 1995 Pursuit of Harimao's Treasure (Harimao no Hiho\r\n> wo Oe)\r\n> SUB Odyssey Anime (v4)\r\n> INP Lupin Gang Anime - timing\r\n\r\nIt's \"Harimao no Zaiho wo Oe!\" And it literally means,\r\n\"After Harimao's Treasure!\" But I like the way most\r\npeople write it, \"Pursuit of.\" A commercial release\r\nwould probably change it a more literal translation\r\n(though AnimEigo, a commercial company,  seems to like\r\ntoying with titles just a little).\r\n\r\n> 1996 Dead or Alive (Deedo oa Araibu)\r\n> SUB Lupin Gang Anime\r\n> INP Odyssey Anime\r\n\r\nThe title screen of this film is actually written in\r\nEnglish, and so are all the video covers. I've only\r\nseen it written as \"Deedo oa Araibu\" on the covers of\r\nthe Japanese film-to-manga adaptations, so I mentioned\r\nit on my site anyway.\r\n \r\n> 1996 Legend of Twlight Gemini\/Secret of Twilight\r\n> Gemini (Towairaito Jemini no Himitsu)\r\n> SUB Odyssey Anime (v2)\r\n> SUB Lupin Gang Anime\r\n> SUB Neko Creations (defunct)\r\n> - Neko's sub scripts are publically available\r\n\r\n\"Legend of Twilight Gemini\" is the official English\r\ntitle, but a translation of the Japanese name would\r\nmake it \"Secret of Twilight Gemini.\"\r\n\r\n> 1997 In Memory of Walther P-38\/Island of Assassins\r\n> (Warusaa P-38)\r\n> SUB Lupin Gang Anime\r\n> INP Odyssey Anime\r\n\r\n\"Island of Assassins\" was NTV's English distro name\r\nfor the film. It's also called \"I.o.A.\" in Spanish\r\nversions. Much like they call \"Kutabare! Nostradamus,\"\r\n\"Farewell to Nostradamus,\" they don't take huge effort\r\nin keeping the titles true to their source names.\r\n\r\n> 1998 Memories of Blaze - Tokyo Crisis (Honoo no\r\n> Kioku - Tokyo Crisis)\r\n> SUB Lupin Gang Anime\r\n> INP Odyssey Anime\r\n> \r\n> 1999 Fujiko's Unlucky Days - Da Capo of Love  (Ai no\r\n> Da Capo - Fujiko's Unlucky Days)\r\n> SUB Odyssey Anime (v1)\r\n> SUB Don Quixote\r\n> INP Lupin Gang Anime\r\n\r\n\"Don Quixote\" is one of many false names for a\r\nbootlegger that exists in New York City. His group has\r\ndone the first 2 Pokemon films (under the name\r\n\"Pikachu Project,\" imitating the Japanese group that\r\nworked on the film's creation), as well as a so-so\r\ncopy of \"Da Capo of Love.\" \r\nIf you visit Anime VCD (I forget the URL, but it's\r\nhosted by Angelfire.com), they sell lots of VCD\r\nversions of \"Don Quixote's\" bootlegs at premium prices\r\n($12+ a pop). Many of these titles are Lupin III\r\nfilms, which are possibly (and likely) VCD conversions\r\nof Lupin Gang Anime subs. \r\nThe font used for \"Da Capo of Love\" is the same that\r\nLGA has used for years, perhaps to \"blend in\" amidst\r\nthe other VCD pirates.\r\n\r\n> 2000 1$ Money Wars\r\n> INP Odyssey Anime\r\n\r\nThe next special, Lupin the Third: Alcatraz\r\nConnection, should be coming out on NTV's Friday\r\nRoadShow this July, and I hope Odyssey will simply\r\njump at the opportunity to make it.\r\n\r\nJust a little FYI for the folks and Rob to help\r\nimprove the FAQ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=====\r\n\"Arsene Lupin III\"\r\nwebmaster@lupinthethird.nospam.com\r\n(Remove \"nospam\" to reply)\r\nhttp:\/\/www.LupintheThird.com\r\n\r\n__________________________________________________\r\nDo You Yahoo!?\r\nGet personalized email addresses from Yahoo!
