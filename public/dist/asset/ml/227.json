The first I heard of it was someone requesting a copy of the dub (or \r\nat least the audio track) to refresh the video since most copies were multi \r\ngeneration.  Now if this does exist, it predates the US theatrical sub of \r\nCagliostro which I thought was the first appearance of Lupin in the US \r\n(Stern's Cliffhanger game notwithstanding).\r\n\r\nI just realised that \"semi-profesional fan dub\" is a bit of an oxymoron.  \r\nThe other information that I hear was that TMS sponsored the dub and it was \r\nshown as an in-flight movie on flights to Japan.  Again, this is all \r\nhearsay...\r\n\r\n=Rob\r\n_________________________________________________________________________\r\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http:\/\/www.hotmail.com.\r\n\r\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \r\nhttp:\/\/profiles.msn.com.\r\n","message_date":"September 25 2000 9:54 AM"}
