{"id":"219","author":"DANIEL ZELTER","subject":"Mamo and Dale","body":"I was at Tales of the Wolf, and I was wondering if the update about the \r\nLupin Mamo dub referred to the Cantonese dub, cus Dale told me about it, and \r\ncalled it the \"Perfect Lupin dub\" or something like that. I also lost his \r\nemail at AX, and was wondering if the guy had it, cus I wouldn't mind \r\ncosplaying as Jigen at AX since his outfits rock! BTW, the Jigen at this AX \r\nhad to have one of those giant mallets they use in Ranma, because plastic \r\nguns weren't allowed for cosplaying. Dale's also the guy who told me about \r\nManga buying Mamo, so I'm sure he's right. He truly is the ultimate Lupin \r\notaku with the belt buckle from Cagliostro, a model Walther and the new \r\nmanga that's not drawn by Monkey Punch but written by him.\r\n_________________________________________________________________________\r\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http:\/\/www.hotmail.com.\r\n\r\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \r\nhttp:\/\/profiles.msn.com.\r\n","message_date":"October 17 2000 6:43 PM"}
