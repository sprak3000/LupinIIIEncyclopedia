{"id":"116","author":"Robert Stickles","subject":"Lupin in English FAQ and some good new\/bad news","body":"Hi everyone,\r\n\r\n     I should be posting an updated version of the Lupin in English FAQ \r\nwithin a day or two.  I usually do this from a different account since \r\nHotmail's interface doesn't lend itself very well to large emails or pastes.\r\n\r\n     On another note it's my sad duty to report that Odyssey Anime will \r\ncease to subtitle and distribute on January 31st.  In the past three years \r\nthis group significantly contributed to Lupin III fandom by subtitling an \r\nimpressive 6 TV specials and 2 theatrical films.  Odyssey also distributed \r\ntheir own work and frequently updated their previous work with error \r\ncorrections and larger, more readable fonts.\r\n     To Donna, Robert and everyone else connected to Odyssey it's been a \r\ngreat ride, thanks for all your efforts and I wish you all the best for the \r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n     With that bit of a down note out of the way it's also come to my \r\nattention that Neko Creations has completed subtitling all of Lupin Sansei, \r\nthe first tv series which premiered in 1971!  This 23 episode series \r\ncontains quite a few key events in the Lupin mythos, such as the \r\nintroduction of all the main characters, particularly Goemon Ishikawa who \r\nstarted off as villian and later joined the Lupin Gang.  The popularity of \r\nthe original TV series even today is quite evident, particularly in Italy.  \r\nThe forthcoming OAV this year (the first such direct to video release for \r\nLupin III in 15 years) is a direct sequel to Episode 2 of this TV series.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nRob S.\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\nJoin the world's largest e-mail service with MSN Hotmail. \r\nhttp:\/\/www.hotmail.com","message_date":"January 27 2002 11:28 PM"}
