{"id":"56","author":"Lupin 7","subject":"Pinky Punky and Scoopers","body":"Hey all,\r\n\r\nI have recently gotten my hands on some Monkey Punch Manga, I think it's \r\ncalled \"One Drunken Night\", or something to that affect(My memory has \r\nprobably distorted what I was told by the person who translated the title \r\nfor me). Anyways, this reminded my of some other Manga Monkey Sensei was \r\nmentioned to have made that I read about in some Lupin FAQ, one called Pink \r\nPunky? Has anyone ever seen this, or the movie Scoopers, also supposed to be \r\nrelated to the Monkey. I am really only interested in knowing if anyone has \r\nphysically seen either of this, because Hear-Say and Conjecture are easy \r\nenough for me to find on my own. I am starting to have my doubts as to the \r\nvalidity of the FAQ I am reading since I have had persons ask around for me \r\nin various Japanese comic shops and they all turn up the same responses, \r\n\"I've never heard of that\". Thanks to anyone with info!\r\n\r\nDavid\r\n________________________________________________________________________\r\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http:\/\/www.hotmail.com\r\n","message_date":"August 12 2000 5:48 PM"}
