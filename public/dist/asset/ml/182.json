I guess thats a silly \r\nquestion. I haven't seen one before, did they make one for the Cagliostro \r\nset? hrmmm, I guess that's another silly question.\r\n\r\nOh, and by the way, I finally got my Store's site going; although we won't \r\nbe accepting orders for at least another day or so, I'd like to know what \r\neveryone thinks of it.\r\nhttp:\/\/store.sansei.st\/\r\n\r\nLastly; I don't mention the stuff I add to my site here on the list(ie when \r\nI update it), but since the last time I mentioned anything about Sansei \r\nStreet I have added lots of junk including at least 120-150 images.\r\n\r\nBombs away!\r\n\r\nDavid\r\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\r\nGet more from the Web.
