{"id":"213","author":"DANIEL ZELTER","subject":"Re: Hrmph","body":"\r\n\"When I was in Tokyo last summer, I took a picture of a prominent temple with Tokyo Tower in the background; I thought it would make a really nice shot, particularely considering the time of day. A few months later I had gotten Tokyo Crisis from Bruce and was dumbfounded to see the exact same picture in the movie.\"\r\n\r\nTokyo Tower figures in a lot of apocalyptic anime where Tokyo's being destroyed. (I've seen it in Gamera and X.) I remember that one person posted a topic for a chat room-for X-that went \"I went to Tokyo Tower and all I got was my brother's head.\" (Spoiler)\r\n\r\nI also want old-school fans to know that AKIRA-the manga-is back, courtesy of Dark Horse. It's gonna be 6 books that are about 300 pages long at 25 bucks a pop. They used the Mavrel translation, but not the color scheme, so I only suggest it for people who weren't there to read it the first time around.  For those who are still saying, \"What the hell did that mean?!\" when they saw the anime, I especially suggest you pick it up. :) Anyway, now on to a Lupin question. Anyone know if they're gonna make a Lupin game for the Dreamcast? Thanks. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http:\/\/explorer.msn.com\r\n","message_date":"December 24 2000 12:09 AM"}
