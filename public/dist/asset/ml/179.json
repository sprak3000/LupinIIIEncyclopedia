Does anyone \r\n> know for sure?\r\n\r\nAccording to Hitoshi Doi's seiyuu database, Makie was voiced by\r\nFujita Toshiko.  Fujita Toshiko does not have a Lupin III entry\r\nin the database, nor has she been listed in any source as playing\r\nFujiko in any of the Lupin series, OAVs, specials, or movies.\r\n\r\n-- \r\nLuis A.
