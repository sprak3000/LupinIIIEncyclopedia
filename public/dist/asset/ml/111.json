Jimmy Flinders. So he\r\nkept it as a stage name. He uses it in the credits of\r\nRobotech, where he played Max Sterling 10 years after\r\nhis role in the musical. So my question is....is Cam a\r\nMormon? Or is he just a friend of some members who\r\nwere looking at making a musical? Not that being a\r\nMormon is a *bad* thing, by any means.....\r\n\r\nBy the way, he has a nice singing voice. ;-)\r\n\r\nIf you care, you can find a copy of the 25th\r\nAnniversary Original Cast recording CD lying arouind\r\nsomewhere.....usually at an LDS-based bookstore like\r\nDeseret Book or Seagull Book and Tape. Maybe even at\r\nBorders or Barnes and Noble....\r\n\r\nNah, didn't think you cared. Till next time!\r\n\r\n\r\n=====\r\n\"Arsene Lupin III\"\r\nwebmaster@lupinthethird.nospam.com\r\n(Remove \"nospam\" to reply)\r\nhttp:\/\/www.LupintheThird.com\r\n\r\n__________________________________________________\r\nDo You Yahoo!?\r\nMake international calls for as low as $.04\/minute with Yahoo!
