{"id":"101","author":"Luis Cruz","subject":"Quick PSX review","body":"Been playing with my new copy of \"Heiwa Parlor! Pro Lupin 3rd Special\".\r\nIt is a pachinko\/slot (or pachi-slot) collection that features two Lupin\r\nmachines.  One of the machines can be seen here:\r\nhttp:\/\/cgi.ebay.com\/aw-cgi\/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=1161537961\r\n\r\nThe other machine has been up on ebay in the past as well.  So, for $50,\r\nI got exact replicas of two $200+ machines to play on my PSX.  When I say\r\nexact replicas, I mean _exact_ replicas.  The music sounds exactly like it\r\nis coming out of a real pachinko machine.  You can adjust the odds on how\r\noften the slot portion will hit, adjust the prize pins, collect stats on\r\nthe machine, and more.  Best of all, you can view all the slot animations\r\nwithout having to get a hit on the slots.\r\n\r\nSo, will I play it a lot?  Not really; this is more the kind of game you\r\nwould put on for a party.  Guests can walk by and amuse themselves for a\r\nfew minutes.  You could start your own little gambling parlor; be the first\r\nyakuza kid on your block! :)\r\n\r\nAmusingly enough, the loading screens for the game are advertisements for\r\nanother pachi-slot collection.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\"I have a To Do pile?!\" - Homer Simpson\r\n\r\nLuis A.
