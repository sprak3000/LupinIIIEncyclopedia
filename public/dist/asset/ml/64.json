{"id":"64","author":"Lupin 7","subject":"Fan Art","body":"Hi Gang,\r\n\r\nI'm compiling a collection of Lupin Fan Art for my site and was wondering if \r\nanyone on the list had any they'd like to see online? All credit is given, \r\nof course. I've gotten two up now and a third person who's working on \r\nsomething; I uploaded the page in case anyone wanted to look it over, it's \r\nhere:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.not-of-this-earth.st\/fa.html\r\nThe first person is my brother; I may not have mentioned him when I \r\nintroduced myself to the list; his name is Steven, he lives in Japan and is \r\na comic artist, hence the sharp contrast between his work and mine(this is \r\neven more pronounced since that work was found in a pile of junk, its at \r\nleast 4-6 years old). Just a bit of warning though, if you click on the back \r\nhome link at the bottom it will take you to the index of the site I uploaded \r\nit to(not my site but one I am making); you might like to see it though, \r\nmore of Steven's art, stuff that is only  a month or so old.\r\n\r\nAnyone have anything? Bruce? Luis? AL3?\r\n\r\nQuestion & comments, can be mailed to me or to the list.\r\n\r\nThanx,\r\n\r\nDavid\r\n\r\nPS. I just thought I'd mention the word 'busty' again, in case it hasn't \r\nbeen said enough;) Seconds anyone?\r\n_________________________________________________________________________\r\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http:\/\/www.hotmail.com.\r\n\r\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \r\nhttp:\/\/profiles.msn.com.\r\n","message_date":"October 4 2000 9:32 PM"}
