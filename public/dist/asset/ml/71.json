{"id":"71","author":"Lupin 7","subject":"Lupin the Third Street","body":"Hey all, thought I'd email you all and tell you I opened my website, Lupin \r\nthe Third Street, http:\/\/lupin.sansei.st\/\r\n\r\nIt took near for ever to make so I hope you enjoy it. Whats on it? Hrmmm, \r\nthats a tuff question. Well, general lists of Movies, Manga, Games, and \r\nMusic; as well as pictures of damn near every thing I could lay my hands on, \r\nincluding my collection, about 35 or so pieces of Manga, and even a few \r\nscreenshots from the 'One Dollar Money Wars'. There is also a tale of Lupin \r\nproportions. And when my busy brother gets around to it the site will be in \r\nJapanese.\r\n\r\nI also added a preview of the Store I keep mentioning; we have lots of \r\nstuff, mostly just manga, toys, and dolls though (even a Lupin drinking \r\nglass). But not everything is listed, including the gotcha gotcha figures. \r\nWhen I open it it will most likely be just in stock items for sale, as our \r\nspecial order idea is proving very difficult to manage.\r\n\r\nOh, and the links section has over 100 links. Hrmmm...\r\n\r\nWell, you'll just have to see it.\r\n\r\nThe email addy on the site is the one you should use to email me, in case \r\nyou wanted to as I will eventually be getting rid of this one; and when I do \r\nI don't believe I'll sign back on to this list. I don't know who David \r\nHayter is, nor do I care about Lupin on DVD (sorry, I'm sure it's a great \r\nachievment).\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDavid Cummings\r\nhttp:\/\/lupin.sansei.st\r\n_________________________________________________________________________\r\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http:\/\/www.hotmail.com.\r\n\r\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \r\nhttp:\/\/profiles.msn.com.\r\n","message_date":"October 29 2000 10:16 AM"}
