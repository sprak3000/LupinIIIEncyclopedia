Right.\r\n\r\n    Holy cow, what a ridiculous thing to say.  What, did you watch the dub\r\nor something?  I mean, I'm not just saying this because I think it was\r\nbrilliant and the most emotionally devastating (fictional) thing I've ever\r\nseen - there was VERY BLATANT AND SIMPLE PSYCHOLOGY ALL OVER THE PLACE, even\r\nif the finer points somehow managed to pass you by.\r\n    Just because it's over your head doesn't mean it isn't there.\r\n\r\n    Then again, you didn't get the significance of the shame and betrayal in\r\nLain... what do you even watch anime for, if you're not paying attention to\r\nthe characters and plot?\r\n","message_date":"September 13 2000 11:58 PM"}
