{"id":"221","author":"DANIEL ZELTER","subject":"Re: Mamo and Dale","body":"\"\"Liberty\" is not that bad; plus, Manga could market it\r\nwith the tag line \"David Copperfield is not the only\r\none that can make the Statue of Liberty disappear.\"\"\r\n\r\nI enjoyed Liberty too, but I'd rather Manga released the good Lupin movies \r\n(Harimao's Treasure, Walther and DOA) so that they could keep the audience \r\ninterested in Lupin. Hopefully Walther won't be too tough to get being 3 \r\nyears old and about to be sold on J dvd. But then Macross 7 is 4 years old, \r\nand companies still haven't gotten the music rights to it.\r\n\r\n\"Probably because the license for it would have been wicked\r\nexpensive.  Mamo was a really old title by then meaning its\r\nmarket value would be very low (as opposed to Cagliostro that\r\nwas labeled everywhere as a classic).  New = more money.\"\r\n\r\nPretty much. I asked reps at Streamline why there weren't more episodes of \r\nthe show brought over here, and they said that the studio charged too much \r\nfor the whole package, so they only asked for the Miyazaki stuff. Luckily \r\nthough, there are no real arcs in the Lupin series (unless LGA knows \r\nsomething I don't ^^;) that would force me to go back to previous episodes \r\nin an effort to find out if I missed anything. Though I don't consider \r\nNostramuas a worthy buy IMHO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________________\r\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http:\/\/www.hotmail.com.\r\n\r\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \r\nhttp:\/\/profiles.msn.com.\r\n","message_date":"October 18 2000 8:28 PM"}
