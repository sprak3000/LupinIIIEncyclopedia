{"id":"153","author":"Mark Stevenson","subject":"Playstation Game","body":"Has anyone else played the Playstation Game of Cagliostro? It came out about \r\n3 years ago (or more???) in Japan. I played through it to the end but it was \r\nkind of short and there was no real challenge, it was just a couple of CDs \r\nfull of nice Lupan style graphics, a few interesting clips and facts from \r\nthe movie. What you did was rescue the girl from the castle. The whole thing \r\nwas in the style of those early C64 text adventures (but with better \r\ngraphics!). If someone knows how to make this game more interesting I'd like \r\nto know. I think there may be some bonus areas or something.\r\n\r\nAlso, Lupan merchandise; I have a Lupan III doll from a gas station in \r\nJapan. You get it when you buy a certain amount of fuel or something. I'll \r\nsee if I can post a photo to the Yahoo! club in the next few weeks. Also, I \r\nhave a full page newspaper add from Japan advertising a \r\nphotocopier\/printer\/fax\/modem thing, using pictures of Lupan, Jigen, Goemon \r\nand Fujiko. The caption reads; \"tanomoshii aibou no odemashi da ze\" and \r\n\"kondo wa ichidai shiyaku(4 yaku)\". My scanner is on the blink so I'll post \r\nit later if anyone wants to see it.\r\n______________________________________________________\r\nGet Your Private, Free Email at http:\/\/www.hotmail.com\r\n","message_date":"January 6 2000 4:08 AM"}
