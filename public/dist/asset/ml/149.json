{"id":"149","author":"Deric Phillips","subject":"miscellaneous","body":"This is just an inconsequential thought, but it recently occurred to me that \r\nit would be one of the greatest comics ever if Monkeypunch and Will Eisner \r\n(if he's still alive) got together to make a Lupin\/Spirit\r\ncrossover.  I don't know how many of you are familiar with the Spirit, but \r\nit's a crimefighter comic from the forties with a very similar feel to that \r\nof Lupin III's, and Eisner's drawing style would accomodate Monkeypunch's \r\nbeautifully, I believe.  If anyone agrees with me, I'd like to hear it, but \r\notherwise this was just a random thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\nMSN Photos is the easiest way to share and print your photos: \r\nhttp:\/\/photos.msn.com\/support\/worldwide.aspx\r\n","message_date":"January 6 2002 3:37 AM"}
