{"id":"23","author":"Osborne,Bruce","subject":"Exploits of Lupin III Prologue","body":"Well, I decided to give it another shot at writing a Lupin fanfic. This\r\ntime it has some promice, here is the Rough Draft to the Prologue:\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.thesoyokaze.net\/fanfic\/LupinIII\/Prologue.txt\r\n\r\nIts called \"Exploits of Lupin III\" I took the name from the old LaBlanc\r\nNovel, but it has no relation in story wise. It totally takes place in an\r\nalternate universe as well, and the characters personalilites are\r\ndifferent. I've always wanted to see Lupin as a mean, cold-hearted,\r\nasshole. Jigen as a father figure to Lupin. Plus Fujiko and Lupin are\r\nactually lovers, and its not the strange relationship they hvae in the\r\nanime. Although Lupin mistreats Fujiko from time to time. Zenigeta's\r\nmotives for wanting to track down Lupin are different as well (you'll read\r\nit in the prologue). Hope everyone enjoys, please give me your comments.\r\n--------------------------------------\r\nBruce Osborne\r\nICQ: 3 1 3 7 9 2 3 7 \r\nEmail: saitoh-hajime@neo.rr.com\r\nURL: http:\/\/anime-world.simplenet.com\/\r\n","message_date":"November 21 1999 1:06 AM"}
