Next in line are \"Fuma\r\nConspiracy\" and \"Golden Legend of Babylon\" (DVD)\r\n\r\nThe latest Japanese Lupin release is the \"One Dollar\r\nMoney Wars\" 2000 TV special (a snippet about it was\r\ncovered in the latest Animerica, as well as a review\r\nof the Cagliostro DVD). \r\n\r\nThe lastest English fansubtitled release has been\r\n\"Fujiko's Unlucky Days\", although Lupin Gang Anime is\r\nstill finishing up the script for their version.\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean by \"most of the TV series\"? In order\r\nfor you to have \"most of it\", you would need about 125\r\nor so episodes (the Lupin TV series 1-3 went into well\r\nover 200 total episodes). If you have that many, I'm\r\nsure many fans would be interested in your proposal.\r\nHowever, if you had that many, they must certainly not\r\nbe ALL subtitled in English (nobody has gone through\r\nthat much effort to subtitle Lupin TV). If they're raw\r\nJapanese, though, I'm still interested. Drop me a line\r\nsometime.\r\n\r\n\r\n=====\r\n\"Arsene Lupin III\"\r\nwebmaster@lupinthethird.nospam.com\r\n(Remove \"nospam\" to reply)\r\nhttp:\/\/www.LupintheThird.com\r\n\r\n__________________________________________________\r\nDo You Yahoo!?\r\nSend instant messages & get email alerts with Yahoo!
