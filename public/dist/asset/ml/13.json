I meant that someone who\r\nwrites you\r\nto tell gripe specifically about your sig (which is what the original\r\npost\r\nseemed to indicate) is basically being a jerk IMO.  If you want to\r\ndiscuss\r\nor complain about dubbing in general, be my guest, but don't jot a\r\nnote to\r\nsomeone griping about their sig.  Maybe I am being the jerk here and\r\nmisunderstanding what the original post meant and stuffing my foot\r\nfarther\r\ndown my throat. :)\r\n\r\n> If we already don't have it subbed....(ask me, I will tell you\r\n> where you can still get it....I got my copy from this particular\r\n> fansub distro)  \r\n\r\nYeah, I'm sure I could get a fansubbed copy, but I would rather get\r\nit on\r\nDVD.  Vote with my dollar to try to get more Lupin over here. :)\r\n\r\n- ---\r\nLuis A.
