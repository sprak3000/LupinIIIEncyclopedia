{"id":"17","author":"Arsene Lupin III","subject":"The New FAQ","body":"Well, I stopped by. I like the notebook paper-type BG. I enjoyed the\r\npiece of article from Toon Magazine (if only you could type the whole\r\nthing). Also nice are the Japanese fonts for each character name\r\n(although MS IE 5 kept asking me to download some files to be able to\r\nread it).\r\n\r\nBut it has one minor flaw: how do non-members of the Lupin ML find it?!\r\nYou can't find it through the Anime Video Games Resource Center, and not\r\nfrom your name itself. By the way, how come you cannot link to the AVGRC\r\nfrom ...\/cruzl\/? All it says is \"Hi. My name is Luis Cruz. I go to\r\nsuch-and-such school and plan to major in such-and-such.\" I'm very\r\nsurprised you don't have links to any of your sub-directories from there.\r\nPerhaps a good suggestion...?\r\n\r\nOther than that, great revamp. I didn't have time to look at the new\r\nanimes and all, but I got the jist. I would like to mention, however,\r\nthat I was planning on *really* revamping the little bugger... (Y'know,\r\nan extremely long links page, lots of custom art scanned-in, new film\r\nreviews, editorials... basically what I was planning on slapping into my\r\nsite, but with the classic info to back it up). I'm still open to ideas\r\non a two-man project....\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------\r\nTalesoftheWolf@Juno.com\r\nLupin the Third\/Mystery Science Theater 3000 Website is at:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.geocities.com\/Tokyo\/Market\/8050\r\n\r\n___________________________________________________________________\r\nGet the Internet just the way you want it.\r\nFree software, free e-mail, and free Internet access for a month!\r\nTry Juno Web: http:\/\/dl.www.juno.com\/dynoget\/tagj.\r\n","message_date":"September 8 1999 11:15 PM"}
