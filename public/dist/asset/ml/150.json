This \r\nimplies that his mother was Japanese -- we've never seen her nor has she \r\nbeen mentioned in the series at all so it's entirely possible.   One of the \r\nFirst Series episodes (I think it's _Beware the Time Machine_) shows one of \r\nLupin's ancestors as being Japanese, but I always took this to be one of \r\nArsene Lupin the 1st's ancestors (shrug).\r\n\r\n\r\n>\"Jigen USA (Chicago),\"\r\n>Jigen may be Japanese-American.\r\n\r\nWe know so little about Jigen that you could form your own theory, and \r\nMonkey Punch has stayed pretty mum about the subject (perhaps deliberately). \r\nThe common \"fled the Chicago mob and changed his name\" story is totally the \r\nwork of fans.  The only concrete background we do have on him is that he was \r\na bodygaurd for a Russian mobster (_Orders to Assassinate Lupin_).  There \r\nare a few snippets in the First and Second TV series as well, but they don't \r\namount to much.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nRob S.\r\n\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\nChat with friends online, try MSN Messenger: http:\/\/messenger.msn.com","message_date":"January 9 2002 5:32 PM"}
