I just love it when people make me feel bad about my site and \r\nmake my miserable life more miserable. Hehe. Yeah, but blast the site all \r\nyou want. If we don't we'll be forced to put a guestbook and message board \r\non our site, we all know how bad that can be. Also, the petition is fucking \r\npetitiful, come on people, sign the god damned thing. I think we are close \r\nto 300, thats about 9700 away from my goal :)\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\nBruce Osborne\r\nsaitoh-hajime@neo.rr.com\r\nICQ : 96064290\r\nTheSoyokaze: www.thesoyokaze.net\r\nBlue Sky Complex: www.thesoyokaze.net\/bluesky\r\nLEMONed Shrine: www.thesoyokaze.net\/lemoned\r\nLupin Encyclopedia: www.thesoyokaze.net\/lupinthe3rd\r\nLupin III Petition: www.thesoyokaze.net\/lupinpetition\/petition.html\r\n","message_date":"January 30 2001 4:44 PM"}
