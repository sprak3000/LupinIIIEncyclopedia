{"id":"138","author":"DANIEL ZELTER","subject":"Lupin in Pulp","body":"There's a small article in the September Pulp(the one with a picture from \r\nJin Roh on the cover) about Lupin's gradual transition from a niche audience \r\nto a mainstream one. It basically gives you the period in which the first \r\nseries came out as a context for understanding the initial angle of the \r\nshow. It also mentions how Miyazaki and Takahata gradually toned it down to \r\ncapture a wider audience. Good stuff.\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http:\/\/explorer.msn.com\/intl.asp\r\n","message_date":"September 19 2001 4:24 PM"}
