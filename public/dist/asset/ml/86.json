{"id":"86","author":"AdaptusMar@aol.com","subject":"Dub Comics (Sounds odd, dosnt it?)","body":"     Ive been procrastenating on sending this letter, mostly because i \r\nforgot the address to the list. Anyway i have the nasty little habit of \r\nchecking Ebay for rare stuff. It was maybe 2 weeks ago that i found the most \r\nintresting thing. it is (according to it's seller) a translated copy of the \r\nFirst Volume of the Lupin Manga. I've got nothing better to do with my money, \r\nso I bought it. I have yet to receive it, so i have no clue if it's real. It \r\ndid mention that the publisher is a company called \"Dub Comics\". After \r\nsearching the net for this company i found nothing. Anyone here heard of it? \r\nI would like to find it so i could find the other volumes(or there release \r\ndates). \r\n\r\n      Can anyone help?","message_date":"May 15 2001 8:27 PM"}
