{"id":"224","author":"DANIEL ZELTER","subject":"Re: Rupan on DVD?!","body":"\"Hopefully we'll have a new dub of Legend of Gold Babylon and of course the \r\npreviously released Sub\/dub of Fuma Conspiracy.\"\r\n\r\nNah, Animeigo should stick to what they know best. Subbing. :)\r\n\r\n\"Given the paltry Lupin offerings on DVD such as Mystery of Mamo, (dub only, \r\npretty sad when a dual language LD of this exists already in the Japanese \r\nmarket) I don't hold much hope for Lupin on DVD in english.\"\r\n\r\nCagliostro did incredibly well, and Manga's considering buying more Lupin, \r\nso let's hope they're smart and they buy Walther.\r\n\r\n\"The entire first series could easily done on two DVD-18's (dual sided dual \r\nlayer) and include the BGM bonuses and both versions of the pilot film.\"\r\n\r\nYeah, but the animation for the first series is only slightly better than \r\nStarblazers. And most newbie fans think that if it looks like Tenchi or \r\nArmitage III(as in cel quality), then that's automatically all that matters.\r\n\r\n\"By the way, this is my first post to the list\"\r\n\r\nI'm just surprised the petition's already reached over 200 in just a few \r\nmonths after Cagliostro was released. I know that's not a lot, compared to \r\nsay, the petition to get the DB manga uncensored, but for Lupin, that's \r\npretty significant. Anyway, now another Lupin question. I saw From Russia \r\nwith Love, and I noticed that it was made around the early 90's. And does \r\nanyone else think that Fujiko dressed up a little like Cindy Crawford in \r\nthat one?\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________________\r\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http:\/\/www.hotmail.com.\r\n\r\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \r\nhttp:\/\/profiles.msn.com.\r\n","message_date":"September 21 2000 3:43 PM"}
