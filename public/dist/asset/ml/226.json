{"id":"226","author":"Arsene Lupin III","subject":"Re: Rupan on DVD?!","body":"> I thought it was later given the title \"Lupin vs\r\n> Fukeshi Ningen\" in Japan \r\n> after Cagliostro was released.  \r\n\r\nPossibly. But in the trailer for \"Plot of the Fuma\r\nClan\" it begins with \"1978: \"Lupin III\"... 1979:\r\n\"Castle of Cagliostro\"... \"1985: The Golden Legend of\r\nBabylon.... Lupin has returned!!.. Lupin: PotFC...etc,\r\netc.\" I think that, since the title \"Lupin the Third\"\r\nwas the films orginal title, it should retain it in a\r\ndomestic release.\r\n\"Lupin the Third\"\r\n(The Movie)\r\nSee, It's not so bad, is it?\r\n\r\n> My Japanese isn't\r\n> that good, but I think \r\n> that translates into \"Lupin vs Immortal Men\".\r\n\r\nI'll go look up \"Fukeshi\" real quick-like....\r\n....\r\nGrr. I'll have to figure out the kanji by visiting a\r\nJapanese site on Lupin. But I know it's either\r\n\"immortal men\" or \"duplicate men\". Cause I know that\r\nat least \"ningen\" means \"men\"\r\n\r\n> That\r\n> title doesn't give away \r\n> as much of plot as the \"Clone\" title.  Is there a\r\n> japanese word for \"clone\" \r\n> or is it a katakana like \"ko ro n\"?\r\n\r\nIn Japan, the film trailors in \"Secret Files\" call it\r\n\"Lupin VS. Kuroon\"\r\n\r\n> The story I\r\n> heard for how the title \r\n> Mystery of Mamo came about was that it was coined by\r\n> an american translator \r\n> who made up the name.  In fact, there was a previous\r\n> Lupin villian called \r\n> Mamo (Mamoo?) from the second TV series.\r\n\r\nLikely you mean Carl Macek, former CEO of Streamline\r\nPictures, which distributed it in English.\r\n\r\n> While we're on the topic of this film, I heard\r\n> rumors that an english \r\n> semi-profesional fan dub of this does exist with a\r\n> script that is very \r\n> faithful to the original script and characters. \r\n> This was apparently made in \r\n> the early 80's or very late 70's.  Can anyone shed\r\n> some light on this?\r\n\r\nYeesh, almost immediately post-release, eh? Wow, I\r\nhave no clue. I won't spread this rumor on, say, the\r\nLupin club or LupintheThird.com until I see proof of\r\nits existence (preferably like I did Lupin the\r\nEighth.... heehee)...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=====\r\n\"Arsene Lupin III\"\r\nwebmaster@lupinthethird.nospam.com\r\n(Remove \"nospam\" to reply)\r\nhttp:\/\/www.LupintheThird.com\r\n\r\n__________________________________________________\r\nDo You Yahoo!?\r\nSend instant messages & get email alerts with Yahoo!
