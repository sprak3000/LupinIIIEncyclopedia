{"id":"170","author":"DANIEL ZELTER","subject":"BIG Lupin news!!","body":"Lupin got a 4 page spread in the Spring 2002 issue of Wizard's \"Anime \r\nInvasion\" where they mention that Lupin is even bigger than Gundam and \r\nPokemon! But that's not the big news. The other 9 Lupin movies have been \r\nannounced: \"Voyage to Danger\", \"Dragon of Doom\", \"Harimao's Treasure\", \r\n\"Farewell to Nostradamus\", \"Dead or Alive\", \"Crisis in Tokyo\", \"The Columbus \r\nFiles\", \"Missed by a Dollar\", and \"Island of Assassin\"! Funi says each film \r\nwill be released every 5-6 months after Gemini. BTW, does anyone know which \r\none is Voyage to Danger?\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\nMSN Photos is the easiest way to share and print your photos: \r\nhttp:\/\/photos.msn.com\/support\/worldwide.aspx\r\n","message_date":"February 24 2002 8:59 PM"}
