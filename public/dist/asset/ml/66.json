{"id":"66","author":"DANIEL ZELTER","subject":"A Cool Mistake","body":"Apparently the list was a lot longer, according to www.animenewsservice.com \r\nThey were categories of the best 100 for favorite series, favorite theme \r\nsong, and favorite characters. Listed under the 9\/12\/00 section of \"Anime \r\nPolls\" is all of the shows, and 50 of the characters. And guess what? Jigen, \r\nFujiko, and Goemon made the list for characters! Jigen is number 17, and \r\nFujiko is 28. Goemon is 43, but he beat Kenshin! I'm just proud that there \r\nare SOME people who don't think that just cus an anime has better cel \r\nquality than one from 20 years ago, that it automatically makes it better \r\nthan the older anime. LUPIN FOREVER!! Since it only shows 50 characters, \r\nZenigata might be on there later. I wish he was on there now though. Oh \r\nwell. 4\/5 ain't bad.\r\n_________________________________________________________________________\r\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http:\/\/www.hotmail.com.\r\n\r\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \r\nhttp:\/\/profiles.msn.com.\r\n","message_date":"September 12 2000 11:34 PM"}
