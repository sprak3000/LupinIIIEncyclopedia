{"id":"55","author":"DANIEL ZELTER","subject":"More Cagliostro Mania","body":"Ok, Cagliostro is playing on a double bill with Princess Mononoke in L.A. \r\nfor TWO MORE DAYS. Go to http:\/\/www.michaelwilliams.com\/beverlycinema\/ for \r\ndetails. You only have Monday and Tuesday left! BTW, I got some Cagliostro \r\nquestions. Some fan at AX told me that DIsney once bought Cagliostro, and \r\nkept in their valts for ten years before the license expired, just so no one \r\nelse would know about it. Is it true? Cus if so, Disney's been an enemy to \r\nanime for a while. They're the reason no one's gotten Sailor Moon R, as DIC \r\nis under them, and they're charging a lot for the show. Anyway, my next \r\nquestion was from a first-time Cagliostro viewer. He was wondering whether \r\nZenigata actually sees Lupin behind the fountain, or is Lupin hiding? My \r\nthought on that is that he does see Lupin, but he doesn't know how to get \r\nhim, and is pausing, in order to think of how to catch him. Your opinions? \r\nAlso, I have my own question about historical accuracy. *SPOILER ALERT for \r\nthose who haven't seen it yet!* I understood that the Romans hid their \r\n\"treasure\" through the clock tower. Now my only question is did they have \r\nclocks in Rome? After all the oldest clock is Big Ben, and that was built \r\nsomewhere between the Dark Ages and the Crusades.\r\n________________________________________________________________________\r\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http:\/\/www.hotmail.com\r\n","message_date":"August 6 2000 9:50 PM"}
