Awesome for a first year \r\nconvention, anyways, here is all the lupin shit I got:\r\n\r\nLittle Lupin gun that shoots him out of clothes and tries to get on Fujiko, \r\ninteresting gadget.\r\n\r\nLittle model thing where lupin is dressed in black tossing a rope above a \r\nbrick wall with a little watch tower.\r\n\r\nSome lupin\/jigen\/car thing which I have no idea what the hell it does.\r\n\r\nA lupin doll.\r\n\r\nI think that's it. Plus I met a girl who liked Lupin, so that was cool, but \r\ndidn't really get to talk to her, just tried to tell her about my site. \r\nAnyways, I need sleep, after no sleep the whole weekend it's what I need \r\n*class calls at 7AM*.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\nBruce Osborne\r\nsaitoh-hajime@neo.rr.com\r\nICQ : 96064290\r\nBlue Sky Complex: www.thesoyokaze.net\/bluesky\r\nLEMONed Shrine: www.thesoyokaze.net\/lemoned\r\nLupin Encyclopedia: www.thesoyokaze.net\/lupinthe3rd\r\n","message_date":"January 29 2001 1:56 AM"}
