{"id":"198","author":"Arsene Lupin III","subject":"Goodbye, Farewell, and Amen.","body":"This is my final post to the Lupin the Third ML for\r\nthe next 2+ years. \r\nI thank you for all your support over the past year or\r\nso as I've worked on my website and so on. \r\n\r\nSome final words:\r\n\r\nBruce: I appreciate the offer to back-up my website!\r\nPlease tell me exactly what URL you plan to put the\r\nsite on and I'll redirect before I'm gone for good (so\r\nwrite me REAL SOON, like, within hours if you can). If\r\nyou wanna toy with some of the site's features, feel\r\nfree (I'm aware of te problem with the Manga index,\r\nbut there's nothing I can really do about it now...if\r\nyou wanna throw together a replacement, that would be\r\ngreat!) Keep up the good work.\r\n\r\nLuis: Good form. You and Bruce have done a fine job\r\ndesigning the Encyclopedia. You deserved that AniPike\r\naward! I hope the Yahoo Lupin III Club picks up again\r\nsoon. Feel free to make any changes you feel\r\nnecessary, as well as kick off any annoying pests that\r\njoin...lol. Have a great life, I'll see you again in a\r\nfew, I hope.\r\n\r\nErik and Gary, My apologies for being unable to\r\ncomplete the Lupin '99 script. Continue the good work,\r\nand I hope to see some more of \"The New Lupin III\" TV\r\nwhen I return! Good luck on future TV special\r\nprojects, too!\r\n\r\nThe rest of the list: I hope my presence hasn't been a\r\nbother to any of you, but if it has, too bad!\r\nHah-hah.... Hope you all have a good time watching\r\nLupin to your heart's content. \r\n\r\nThe closing moments of the greatest anime film ever\r\nmade:\r\n\r\nLupin: Sayounara, sayounara!\r\nClarisse: Sayounara!\r\nZenigata: Blast it! He has stolen again!\r\nClarisse: You're mistaken, he has stolen nothing!\r\nZenigata: On the contrary! He stole something valuable\r\nand priceless...your heart.\r\nClarisse: Hai.\r\n\r\nSayounara, minna-san...sayounara.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=====\r\n\"Arsene Lupin III\"\r\nwebmaster@lupinthethird.nospam.com\r\n(Remove \"nospam\" to reply)\r\nhttp:\/\/www.LupintheThird.com\r\n\r\n__________________________________________________\r\nDo You Yahoo!?\r\nYahoo!
