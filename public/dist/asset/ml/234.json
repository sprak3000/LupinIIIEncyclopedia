{"id":"234","author":"DANIEL ZELTER","subject":"Re: Lupin On The Top Ten!","body":"\"lain is the Blade Runner of anime,\"\r\n\r\nIt's got the feel of Blade Runner, though A.D. Police is the only real \r\ncyberpunk anime IMHO.\r\n\r\n\"and just like Ridley Scott didn't come out in the film and say \"Decker is a \r\nreplicant!\",\"\r\n\r\nHe did a few months ago. ^^\r\n\r\n\"the creators of lain didn't come out and say what lain is.  This is what \r\nmakes lain and Blade Runner great sci-fi.\"\r\n\r\nI enjoyed Lain a lot, but was that scene with Arisu-um-cybering with her \r\nteacher necessary? I mean that on scene kind of ruined the strength of the \r\nanime for me. *spoiler if I can interpret it right* The whole computer \r\nuniverse falls apart just cus Lain KNOWS Arisu's secret?! Cmon. Give me a \r\nmore mature impetus than that. Other than that gripe, I had no problem with \r\nLain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________________\r\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http:\/\/www.hotmail.com.\r\n\r\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \r\nhttp:\/\/profiles.msn.com.\r\n","message_date":"September 13 2000 9:24 PM"}
