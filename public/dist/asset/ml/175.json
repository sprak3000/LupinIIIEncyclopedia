The car I mentioned, the Alfa Romeo Grand Sport, looks similar to the Benz 300 SSK. According to a book I have on the TV series, not the first, I think the second. The car is a Alfa Romeo Grand Sport 1930; it has a nice fold out poster with hand drawn pictures of it and the Fiat 500. Personally from the pics below, I can only remember seeing the Alfa; does the SSK resemble the one pictured below?\r\n\r\nheres pics of the SSK:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.fineartmodels.com\/sskl.htm\r\nheres pics of the Sport:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.christophgrohe.com\/list_of_cars\/moretti.html\r\n\r\nDavid.\r\n\r\nRobert, where is the site you maintain?\r\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________\r\nSign up for FREE email from Lupin the Third Street at http:\/\/lupin.sansei.st\r\n","message_date":"September 11 2001 9:15 PM"}
