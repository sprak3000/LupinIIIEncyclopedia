A brand new look for the Lupin Encyclopedia that me and Luis \r\nand have been working on for god knows how long. It'll be a much better \r\ndesign and easier for *YOU* the user to look around and stuff. Will post on \r\nhere when that's actually uploaded (hopefully sometime tonight). Anyways, \r\noff to the doctor's. Just wanted to let everyone know.\r\n\r\nAlso, did anyone know of that Lupin Online Store? It's on the Lupin \r\nStreet's website.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\nBruce Osborne\r\nsaitoh-hajime@neo.rr.com\r\nICQ : 96064290\r\nTheSoyokaze: www.thesoyokaze.net\r\nBlue Sky Complex: www.thesoyokaze.net\/bluesky\r\nLEMONed Shrine: www.thesoyokaze.net\/lemoned\r\nLupin Encyclopedia: www.thesoyokaze.net\/lupinthe3rd\r\n","message_date":"January 30 2001 4:18 PM"}
