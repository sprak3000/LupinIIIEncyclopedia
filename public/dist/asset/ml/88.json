I've been drifting in and out of\r\nanime fandom lately but I still love Lupin, although lack of new translated\r\nepisodes to the original series has left me hanging. Anyhow, I'm posting\r\ncause I found this drawing a did awhile back and I thought it was funny.\r\nIt's a shoujo version of Lupin III (Goemon is a girl to complete the love\r\ntriangle seen in many shoujo like Marmalade Boy. Also I think Zenigata is\r\nsupposed to be the principal).\r\n\r\n.....\r\n\r\nOh well, I thought it was funny.\r\nhttp:\/\/www.angelfire.com\/emo\/billyidol\/art\/gakuen.gif","message_date":"April 25 2001 12:14 AM"}
