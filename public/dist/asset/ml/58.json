Here's a little tidbit of trivia for you:\r\n\r\nDavid Hayter (Manga Video voice for Lupin III): Solid Snake in \"Metal\r\nGear Solid\"\r\nCam Clarke (Streamline Pictures voice for Lupin III): Liquid Snake in\r\n\"Metal Gear Solid.\" \r\n\r\nHMMMM!!!! ISN'T THAT interesting???!!!\r\n\r\nBTW, I'm taking a stab at the possibility that the David Hayter from the\r\nGuyver 2 and X-men screenplay is a different man from Snake\/Lupin, and\r\nthat the Internet Movie DB has crossed a wire or two.... but then, I've\r\nnever seen \"Guyver 2\", so....\r\nAlso, Cam Clarke has gone by other names, so \"Cam Clarke\" may not be in\r\nMGS' credits, FYI....\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n<Webmaster@LupintheThird.nospam.com>\r\nremove the \"nospam\" to write me\r\nhttp:\/\/www.LupintheThird.com\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________\r\nYOU'RE PAYING TOO MUCH FOR THE INTERNET!\r\nJuno now offers FREE Internet Access!\r\nTry it today - there's no risk!
