I must have missed this when it was first posted.\r\n>\r\n>   If you still have it around, copy it and nip over to spamcop.net,\r\n\r\nWhat ever the Doctor orders...\r\n\r\nDespite the lack of interest(except for Danny I think); I thought I'd point \r\nout that the Sansei Street Store is now open. For those who have been \r\nkeeping up with it though, as the site states the Cagliostro lighters were \r\nthe only thing we couldn't get in this shipment; everthing else including \r\nthe Strip Gun, the RC Car, and the big action figures are here.\r\nhttp:\/\/store.sansei.st\/\r\n\r\nI uploaded 60 screenshots from Mamo to the site; and two new sections. One \r\nis of interest called, 'Sightings of a Lupin Kind!' Which includes a bunch \r\nof interesting Lupin pictures not to be found else were. When I was in Tokyo \r\nlast summer, I took a picture of a prominent temple with Tokyo Tower in the \r\nbackground; I thought it would make a really nice shot, particularely \r\nconsidering the time of day. A few months later I had gotten Tokyo Crisis \r\nfrom Bruce and was dumbfounded to see the exact same picture in the movie. \r\nYou know that scene where Goemon is up on the Temple with what looks like \r\nthe Eifal Tower in the background. Bingo. That tower by the way is called \r\nTokyo Tower and it is a full scale reproduction of the Eifal Tower.\r\n\r\nJust a little bit of Lupin trivia you all can munch on.\r\n\r\nDavid Cummings\r\nlupinsansei_st@yahoo.com\r\nhttp:\/\/lupin.sansei.st\/\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http:\/\/explorer.msn.com\r\n","message_date":"December 24 2000 3:13 AM"}
