Though it's a cool \r\ndramatic vehicle, why use it on the very next TV special?\r\n\r\nThe worst part of the film was the ending . Once again set on an  street \r\ncorner, our heroes are wearing summer clothes (short sleeves and SHORTS)\r\n including Goemon!!! He not only looks ridiculous but it isn't played for \r\nit's funny nature, he just happens to be wearing it.\r\n\r\nWell, i'm pleased to see ANY Lupin film, but I think they should try to make \r\nthese seem more like movies than TV episodes that just repeat situations \r\nconstantly.\r\n\r\nSteve","message_date":"August 8 2001 10:48 PM"}
