{"id":"235","author":"DANIEL ZELTER","subject":"Re: Lupin On The Top Ten!","body":"\"lain is the Blade Runner of anime,\"\r\n\r\nI may have posted this before, so if I repeat it, it's cus I'm not sure it \r\ngot sent.\r\n\r\nI recognize the Blader Runner elements, but we all know BGC is the original \r\nBlade Runner-inspired anime. Though the only real cyberpunk anime for me is \r\nA.D. Police.\r\n\r\n\"and just like Ridley Scott didn't come out in the film and say \"Decker is a \r\nreplicant!\",\"\r\n\r\nHe admitted that fact recently heh.\r\n\r\n\"the creators of lain didn't come out and say what lain is.  This is what \r\nmakes lain and Blade Runner great sci-fi.\"\r\n\r\nMy only complaint about Lain was the scene with Arisu cybering with her \r\nteacher. Was that really necessary? Seemed more like fanservice to me.\r\nI mean, cmon, Lain spreading around that information and thus destroying the \r\nfabric of the computer world is kind of condescending. But other than that I \r\nmostly enjoyed Lain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________________\r\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http:\/\/www.hotmail.com.\r\n\r\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \r\nhttp:\/\/profiles.msn.com.\r\n","message_date":"September 13 2000 9:42 PM"}
