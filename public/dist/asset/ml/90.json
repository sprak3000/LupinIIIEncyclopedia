Though it \r\nstates it's the TV special best of, it has a large amount of the film themes \r\nas well. This is the most useful of the recent Lupin releases because you \r\ndont have to buy the indivudual soundtracks for one song.\r\nThough most songs are strictly in Japanese, there is some english.\r\n\r\n\r\nLUPIN THE EURO HYPER GROOVE PROJECT\r\n released: 2\/28\/2000 WPC7-10065\r\nrunning time:59:09\r\nTracks:\r\n1-(trigger hyper euro vers.)\r\n2-(trigger vers)\r\n3-(red monster vers)\r\n4-(disco plays Lupin-new generation ver)\r\n5-(red monster vers 2)\r\n6-(afro rock theme)\r\n7-(B4ZA beat)\r\n8-(trigger hyper house)\r\n9-(new generation)\r\n10-(special non-stop Lupin the Euro hyper groove)\r\n\r\nUh.... At first I thought, what the hell was this. Well, the Punch the Monkey \r\nseries was so popular, I...guess...this makes sense. So, cautiously I picked \r\nit up and guess what..it's pretty good.\r\nThis is familar Lupin themes done in a euro-beat house style. Expect a steady \r\nrhythm that runs thru ALL the tracks. Some tracks are repititious, but it is \r\nsuch a different CD than any other Lupin CD's, it's an interesting addition \r\nto the collection. The first pressings had a metallic version of the front \r\ncover. Oh, yes...the front cover features a topless Fujiko (facing Lupin), \r\ncertainly the most unique of the Lupin CD covers.\r\n\r\nCD SINGLE\r\nLupin the Third (Theme from Tokyo Crisis)\r\nreleased:7\/23\/98 VPDG-20762\r\nrunning time:11:52\r\nTracks:\r\n1-(Theme from Tokyo Crisis)\r\n2-Love Squall (piano vers)\r\n3-(Theme from Tokyo Crisis-instrumental)\r\n\r\nPackaged in the slim line container on a 3 inch CD, this is a good purchase \r\nif you dont want to buy the entire soundtrack. There hasnt been many CD \r\nsingles, but this is a good release.\r\n\r\nStay tuned.\r\n\r\nSteve","message_date":"April 9 2001 11:12 PM"}
