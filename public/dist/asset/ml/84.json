{"id":"84","author":"outkast@goconnect.net","subject":"hi","body":"Hello, im new to the lupin mailing list so I should introduce myself.  \r\nMy name is Luvien Martin and I was born and live in Melbourne, \r\nAustralia.  I first found out about lupin on my first visit to Italy \r\nwhen i was 4 years old, i loved it.  Since then i have been back to \r\nItaly twice, the second time being when i was 9 and the third when i \r\nwas 14.  I never missed an episode while i was over there, 4 years \r\nlater I'm still dying to see more.  Anyways enough from me, I was \r\nwondering if anyone knew of an IRC channel dedicated to lupin and could \r\nget back to me with the server its on, thanks.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nLuvien Martin\r\n","message_date":"February 1 2001 4:25 AM"}
