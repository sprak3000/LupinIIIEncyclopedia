{"id":"146","author":"DANIEL ZELTER","subject":"It's really amazing","body":"I think I've seen more Lupin news in this year than over the last 3 years \r\nthat I've been here. Hopefully this is good for us all. I kind of feel like \r\na round of congratulations is necessary. First of course, I wanna thank Luiz \r\nand Bruce for keeping the Encyclopedia and Petition up at their own expense, \r\nbut for our sake as well. It'll truly be a great beacon for future Lupin \r\nfans to learn more about him. Second, I wanna thank LGA for continuing to \r\nfansub Lupin in a world where crap like DBZ and Eva would get more \r\nattention. And finally, a round of applause for all ML and non-ML fans. You \r\ncontinued to support Lupin, to the point that he was saved from being buried \r\nwith the rest of the Streamline catalog. Anyway, it's a damn good time to be \r\na Lupin fan. Manga and Funimation have shown interest in the movies. \r\n[Animeigo is slow to release Rupan on dvd, but that goes for most of their \r\ntitles anyway, so that's a given.] Comicsone might pick up the manga. Lupin \r\nhas his own DDR-like game. Hell, he even has his first arcade game in nearly \r\n20 years! So all I can say is, let's keep up the good work, til we see as \r\nmany people wearing Lupin t-shirts as there are t-shirts for DBZ. :)\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http:\/\/explorer.msn.com\/intl.asp\r\n","message_date":"October 29 2001 10:44 AM"}
