FUNimation is already done with\r\nthe DVD itself, and has been for a good two weeks or\r\nso now. Even if there is an uncut sub still in the\r\nworks (which is unlikely, VHS is pretty much dub-only\r\nacross the board these days), I doubt they would\r\nchange that due to a desire for continuity between\r\nreleases. \r\n\r\nLupin III in America already has enough discontinuity\r\nbetween releases anyway, having been touched on by 4\r\ncompanies total, some calling him \"Loo-pin,\" others\r\n\"Loo-pawn,\" yet more \"Roo-pawn,\" and some simply \"the\r\nWolf.\" Speaking of names, I have heard the FUNimation\r\nrelease may be calling him \"Loo-pin\" instead of\r\n\"Loo-pawn\" (or the French pronunciation, something\r\nlike \"Loo-peh,\" which you can occasionally catch\r\nZenigata calling our hero). Though not confirmed, it\r\nis what I have heard. I will confirm this when I have\r\nthe chance.\r\n\r\nKeep sending in those suggestions to Funimation (I\r\nprefer suggestions to questions, I don't know if there\r\nare some things they will answer that I'll be unable\r\nto pass on to the public)!\r\n\r\n--Reed\r\n\r\n__________________________________________________\r\nDo You Yahoo!?\r\nYahoo!
