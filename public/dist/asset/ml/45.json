{"id":"45","author":"Mr. Dingle","subject":"Re: My Favorite Lupin!","body":"I just got my favorite Lupin the 3rd CD so far....it's called \"Lupin the 3rd Music From The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack Score\" and basically it's cover versions of the music from the first series (lovingly compiled on the Lupin the 3rd '71 m.e. tracks) done in disco, samba, jazz, bossa nova and rock styles  by the original composer, Takeo Yamashita.  If you've heard the music from the first series, imagine it in stereo without the sound effects.  It rocks!!!  If anyone's interested it's on Columbia and the number is 28CC-2291.  \r\nDingle","message_date":"May 14 2000 1:54 AM"}
