Lupine\r\nmeans wolf - so it seemed a natural choice - also he\r\nis a \"wolf\" when it comes to the ladies. Eventually\r\nthe slow introduction of Lupin with out the reference\r\nto *Arsene Lupin* came to pass.\" (asterisk emphasis\r\nadded)\r\n\r\nTo reiterate, I believe he's saying that he was able\r\nto convince TMS to lighten the grip a bit and allow\r\nthem to use the name \"Lupin\" as long as they do not\r\ndistinguish the name as Arsene Lupin (although in\r\n\"Mamo,\" they come delightfully close to doing so).***\r\n[more on this at the end]\r\n\r\n> Even more laughable is the translation of the\r\n> Katakana on the 'gift' in \r\n> Babylon as \"to Rupan\".  I'm so glad they never\r\n> dubbed Babylon. :-)\r\n\r\nActually, if you rewatch Babylon (a daunting task, I\r\nknow), you'll notice that the writing on the gift was\r\nactually in English! It said \"To LUPIN\" in big block\r\nletters!\r\nAnd during the same shot, it says in the subtitles:\r\n\"Mr. Rupan, we have a special delivery for you!!\"\r\nOne of my favorite moments in Lupin history.\r\n \r\n> \r\n> >It's unfortunate that Manga did not use more common\r\n> >sense in re-dubbing \"Cagliostro.\"\r\n> \r\n> In what way?

Maybe I'm\r\n> getting mixed up (Oh, do I \r\n> hate rewatching the source material for small\r\n> details ;-))\r\n\r\nManga got a lot of things right, but when I refer to\r\nManga's baka-baka on Cagliostro, I'm referring to the\r\nfact that it was not dubbed for mass-marketing. By\r\nmass-marketing, I'm referring to the fact that\r\n\"Cagliostro\" is almost a perfect family film. Had the\r\ndub script stuck fairly close to the subtitle track\r\nNeil provided (with said mass-market appeal in mind),\r\nI would be far more comfortable than I am now\r\nrecommending Cagliostro's 2000 dub to younger viewers.\r\n\r\nManga only pronounced Cagliostro exactly right on one\r\noccasion: when it was spoken during the wedding by the\r\n\"Archbishop\" (Kaw-lee-OH-strow). Every other time it\r\nwas slighty goofed: \"CA-lee-oh-strow\"...with \"ca\" as\r\nin \"cap,\" or \"Kaw-lee-AW-strow.\"\r\n\"Caggy\" (in the clock tower) was in the subs, but I\r\nthink Neil should have called him \"Collie\" or\r\nsomething that flowed better audio-wise as well as\r\nmatched the Japanese line (\"Kali-kun!\"). It's the one\r\nsituation where I almost wish Manga *had* strayed from\r\nNeil's script.\r\nYeah, I'm perfectly aware of all the significant\r\nshortcomings that lie in the Streamline dub. However,\r\nI personally loved most of the old voice cast, and the\r\nscript was just a lot of fun to listen to, even if it\r\n*was* way off.\r\n\r\nAbout the name, I think its poor pronunciation in\r\n\"Mamo\" and \"Capers\" *might* have to do with the whole\r\n\"Lupin, but not Arsene Lupin\" concept. Then again,\r\nit's just as likely that Macek, et al. simply did not\r\nknow how to pronounce it. And technically, it's\r\npronounced \"Loo-PAN.\" Like a cooking \"pan.\" That's\r\njust how the French say it. I think \"Loo-pawn\" sounds\r\nway smoother though. ^_^\r\n\r\n> IMO Goeman's name is the most maligned in dubs.... \r\n> everything from \r\n> 'Gooey-man' to 'Go-man'.  Yuck.\r\n\r\nI agree. \"Go-ay-mown.\" (And that's \"ow\" as in \"mow\"\r\nnot as in \"Ow!\") Can it really be that hard for people\r\nto say?? BTW, it's spelled \"GoemOn.\" But maybe you\r\nknew that already...it can be hard to tell\r\nsometimes..... ;-)\r\n\r\n***About \"coming delightfully close\" to mentioning\r\nArsene Lupin in Mamo, here's a transcription from a\r\nchase scene where Lupin\/Jigen\/Goemon are being pursued\r\nby Zenigata and the French police. Zenigata is yelling\r\nthrough a megaphone from the police car.\r\n\r\nZeni: \"...So why don't you save us both a lot of\r\ntrouble and give it up now?\"\r\nJigen (to Lupin): \"Give up? He's gotta be crazy!\"\r\nLupin: \"You're right. Besides, my family would never\r\nlive down the shame.\"\r\n\r\nYou gotta admit, that's a pretty sly little reference.\r\n\r\n\r\n=====\r\n\"Arsene Lupin III\"\r\nwebmaster@lupinthethird.nospam.com\r\n(Remove \"nospam\" to reply)\r\nhttp:\/\/www.LupintheThird.com\r\n\r\n__________________________________________________\r\nDo You Yahoo!?\r\nGet personalized email addresses from Yahoo!
