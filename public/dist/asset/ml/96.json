The mailbox that i am using now will be shutting down by the end of the month and i would like to change addys. I tried to write the list owner but without luck so far, and majordomo will not let me subcribe at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut on a lighter note..did anyone get the Lupin Box set? I preordered mine on the last avalable day but wont find out if i got it for another 2 weeks. I havent recieved any phonecalls so it could be good.\r\n\r\n\r\nTam\r\n\r\n\r\n***********************************************************************\r\n\r\nFREE ANIMATED eCARDS!\r\nThey're fun.
