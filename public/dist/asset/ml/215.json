{"id":"215","author":"Chris Dick","subject":"Re: Hrmph","body":"A Lupin driving game for console systems would be excellent. Not only do \r\ngame creators and animators have a well of content from which to draw, but \r\nthey also have the potential generate an interesting script, taking the \r\nCrazy Taxi (one of the best games ever!) theme of drive and drop to another \r\nlevel.\r\n\r\nWe should all coverge on a game concept (well, we already have one here), \r\ncome up with a central theme and submit it to game companies. I know most \r\ncompanies don't accept submissions, but this one could really take off as \r\nfar as I'm concerned.\r\n\r\nFor instance, Lupin and his trusty sidekicks could deliver a myriad of \r\nclients (or treasure) he's working for off at various destinations around \r\nthe world (what Lupin game wouldn't be without worldwide locations), but if \r\nhe fails in the allotted time given, he's arrested by, of course, Zenigata. \r\nAs with any Lupin story, it's never just Zenigata after Lupin, so the game \r\nwould have to include some international organization that's trying to \r\nachieve the same goal for its own capitalist(or evil?) interests.\r\n\r\nWell, that's a very ROUGH idea and to skirt past any copyright or \r\nintellectual property speedbumps, the name \"Cliffhanger\" could simply be \r\nlicensed from NTV (or whoeever owns the rights). NTV could then produce a \r\nsummer TV special or feature length movie to tie in the game concept and \r\nthen to market it to toys and whatnot. Hmm...wish i had a few million to \r\nblow - it'd do this in a second.\r\n\r\nThoughts...\r\nchris\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http:\/\/explorer.msn.com","message_date":"December 24 2000 11:51 PM"}
