{"id":"79","author":"Arsene Lupin III","subject":"British Lupin","body":"> Goodbye Lady Liberty is dubbed in the UK using the\r\n> same cast as Mystery of\r\n> Mamo (called Secret of Mamo in UK).\r\n\r\nWhoa, don't confuse the poor people here.\r\nWe ahould note that \"Mystery of Mamo\" had 2 English\r\ndubs. One was by Streamline Pictures (Lupin was named\r\n\"Lupin III.\"), and a British one from Manga UK (Lupin\r\nwas named \"Wolf III\"). So you're basically saying that\r\nit uses the same voice cast as the UK dub of \"Secret\r\nof Mamo\". An interesting note: the UK dub's cast\r\nimitated American accents. The reason they re-dubbed\r\nit was likely the \"Lupin name\" legal issue.\r\n\r\n> Both are rated\r\n> as 12 here and, in my\r\n> opinion, are excellent releases.  It is true that\r\n> some anime films are\r\n> poorly dubbed with extra swear words not found in\r\n> the original Japanese\r\n> version.  A good example of this is Cyber City Oedo\r\n> 808, which is completely\r\n> different from the Japanese version.\r\n\r\ncough, cough--Manga's Cagliostro re-dub--cough, cough\r\n\r\n> The Lupin\r\n> films are probably the best\r\n> dubs available.\r\n\r\nBy the way, the UK release of Cagliostro- was it an\r\noriginal UK dub or was it simply a PAL version of\r\nStreamline Pictures's dub from 1992?\r\n\r\n\r\n=====\r\n\"Arsene Lupin III\"\r\nwebmaster@lupinthethird.nospam.com\r\n(Remove \"nospam\" to reply)\r\nhttp:\/\/www.LupintheThird.com\r\n\r\n__________________________________________________\r\nDo You Yahoo!?\r\nYahoo!
