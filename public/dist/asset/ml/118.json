Of course it's about\r\nprofits, the licensing and distribution of media is a commercial enterprise.\r\nIt's not fair to expect people's kids to go hungry so you can watch free\r\nmovies.\r\n    I don't think you're likely to get anyone's cardboard box repossessed by\r\nbootlegging (I know no-one even mentioned bootlegging, but it's relevant)\r\nSixth Sense or Charlie's Angels or Shrek or something, but when it comes to\r\nanime which is predominantly distributed by indies, it's best to pursue the\r\nproper channels.\r\n\r\n    This doesn't apply, obviously, to stuff no-one brings over (like... all\r\nLupin^_^) but with stuff that does get distributed here, if you don't buy\r\nthat release, that's a vote against licensing anime in North America.  If\r\nno-one makes any money on it, they can't do it.\r\n\r\n    so... yea consumerism.\r\n","message_date":"January 30 2002 9:37 AM"}
