Firstly, PM3 is \r\nexcellent, especially the Super Hero remix by the Orangers and the Theme \r\nfrom Lupin the Third 3(tracks 2 and 4 respectively); I haven't finished \r\nwatching $1 yet but its pretty good, especially the chase at the beginning. \r\nI'll provide some Mp3s and some screens in a few days if I'm not too lazy \r\nabout it(no guarantees); I work and sleep so, you know how stressfull \r\nsleep...I mean work, can be.\r\n\r\nPunch the Monkey 3!:\r\n1. Lupin the IIIrd 97'\r\n2. Super Hero\r\n3. Theme from Lupin the IIIrd 3\r\n4. Theme from Lupin the IIIrd 3(different artist than above)\r\n5. Toward the Patrol Line\r\n6. Love Theme\r\n7.
