{"id":"76","author":"Tamara Williamson","subject":"Re: the \"lupin\" thing","body":"I haven't been lucky in the movie department lately. The only ones that I've found\/seen were Castle of Cagliostro, mystery of Mamo, Legend of Gold Babalon, and Fuma Conspiricy. Other than the few Tales of the Wolf tapes on Ebay its scarce in my area. If I may ask where has everyone been lucky in finding sub\/dub issued tapes? \r\n\r\nBut with Lupin games I have been lucky and half finished collecting them. I just wish someone made a Sega saturn emulator so I could get the .avi's of the classic TV Lupin.\r\n\r\nTo answer the work question...I work for Eidos Interactive. I work in QA and have a part time gig in Development (Level and Story design) for small project in the company. What types of things did ya want to know David, or anything for that matter. I will only tell what I can =)\r\n\r\nTam\r\n\r\n\r\n********************************\r\nwww.chickclick.com\r\n\r\nSign up for free email.\r\nhttp:\/\/chickmail.chickclick.com\r\n\r\nWin free stuff!\r\nhttp:\/\/contests.chickclick.com\r\n********************************\r\n","message_date":"December 12 2000 4:57 PM"}
