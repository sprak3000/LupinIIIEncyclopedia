I don't even see what Shinji \r\ngetting off on Asuka has to do with the series.\r\n\r\nBut I still support Lain.\r\n\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________________\r\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http:\/\/www.hotmail.com.\r\n\r\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \r\nhttp:\/\/profiles.msn.com.\r\n","message_date":"September 13 2000 11:45 PM"}
