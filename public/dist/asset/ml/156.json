(Hey Valerie,\r\n>what are your thoughts as a Lupin cel owner and shopper?)\r\n\r\nThere have been a recent influx of Lupin cels from the new \"Fujiko's Unlucky\r\nDays\" movie (I'm judging, from the artwork), but old tv series cels are hard\r\nto come by. Also, interestingly, the most expensive anime cel I've ever seen\r\nwas from Cagliostro. It was 6,000 something dollars and came with the\r\noriginal background (image is here\r\nhttp:\/\/members.tripod.com\/~ssjvidel\/want.gif). After losing my job I haven't\r\nbeen able to buy a lot of cels, but besides Cagliostro, the newest movie and\r\nthe second tv series, I haven't seen any at all. \r\n\r\n>The first series more closely resembles the original manga; once Miyazaki\r\n>got his hands on it, Lupin became too much of a gentleman.  What I like\r\n>about the manga and first series is the concept that Lupin is descendant\r\n>of a gentleman thief but has pretty much turned out to be the opposite.\r\n>Kind of that rebellious, \"I won't be like my parents\" attitude we can\r\n>all identify with. :)\r\n\r\nHeh. I love Lupin.\r\n\r\n\r\n-valerie \r\nhttp:\/\/members.tripod.com\/~valerie\r\n----------\r\nLike rescuing precious stones that are confined in a safe...\r\nIt would be unjust to leave a girl here to be made a bride...\r\nI will tell you the tale of the green fields.\r\nThis is the work of every thief.\r\n-Lupin, Cagliostro no Shiro","message_date":"January 7 2000 3:43 PM"}
