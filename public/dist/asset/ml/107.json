So did any other Lupin otaku take the plunge?\r\n\r\nYeah a fellow named Dale Engelhard, the one you call\r\n\"the Lupin CosPlay God\"....or something like that....\r\nHere is his story:\r\n----\r\nHe is very busy working on three non-Lupin related\r\nfilms. They are \"Musashi,\" feudal era period anime\r\nwith sci-fi mix story; \"Scheherazade,\" still working\r\non an adaptation of Arabian nights; and a bold idea to\r\nremake and animate the Kurosawa classic, \"The Seven\r\nSamurai.\" He is in league with ACC studio, and is\r\nattempting to make some important connections here in\r\nthe States. He does, by the way, look very healthy, he\r\nis still smoking though.... I videotaped most of the\r\npanel for posterity, and I got him to draw me another\r\nFujiko.... Other highlights included meeting Boba Fett\r\nactor J.Bulloch, and artist, Olivia, who was a\r\nfavorite and as much an honor as I could imagine. \r\n----\r\n\r\nBTW, Daniel, now that I mentioned it, I'll be sure to\r\ncomment on you calling him \"The God of Lupin CosPlay.\"\r\nI'm sure he'd appreciate it. ^_^\r\n\r\nTTFN (tata for now!)\r\n\r\n\r\n=====\r\n\"Arsene Lupin III\"\r\nwebmaster@lupinthethird.nospam.com\r\n(Remove \"nospam\" to reply)\r\nhttp:\/\/www.LupintheThird.com\r\n\r\n__________________________________________________\r\nDo You Yahoo!?\r\nMake international calls for as low as $.04\/minute with Yahoo!
