A brand new look for the Lupin Encyclopedia that me and Luis \r\n\r\nFew addendums to Bruce's announcement.  First, the site relys on\r\nhaving JavaScript turned on; if you would like to know why, email\r\nme off the list, and I will be happy to explain it to you.  Still\r\nworking on what to do if someone comes in w\/o JavaScript on, but\r\nthat is becoming very rare these days.\r\n\r\nSecond, please do not hesitate to send myself or Bruce feedback\r\non the site.  I do not care if it is positive or negative.  We\r\nare constantly bouncing ideas off of each other to make the\r\nsite more useable.  Any comments, suggestions, etc. about the\r\nlook and feel of the site are most welcome.  We want to make\r\nthe site a good source of information that is easy to use\r\nas well.\r\n\r\n-- \r\nLuis A.
