Another interesting thing\r\nit noted is that Fuma Conspiracy was an OVA at first but\r\nwas eventually shown in theaters anyway.\r\n\r\nI highly recommend picking this issue up; the article\r\nwas compiled from various TMS articles and press.\r\nGo to http:\/\/www.toonmagazine.com\/ to find out how to\r\nget your copy; just be prepared for a long wait! :)\r\n\r\nOn a different note, I am in the process of reworking\r\nthe Lupin FAQ.  Should be up sometime next week.  Hope\r\nsomeone is happy about this besides me. :)\r\n\r\n- ---\r\nLuis A.
