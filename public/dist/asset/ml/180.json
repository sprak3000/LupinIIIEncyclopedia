I have a question for people. I don't like to do \r\ncovers from scratch, so i'm asking people here if they have high-rez scans \r\nof the following:\r\n\r\n1. Pursuit of Harimao's Treasure\r\n2. Liberty Crisis\r\n3. Napolean's Dictionary\r\n4. Dark Order of Assasination\r\n5. Fujiko's Unlucky Days\r\n\r\nIf anyone can help, i'd be a happy man. And, no, i'm not going to replicate \r\nthe covers and sell them...\r\n\r\nChris\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http:\/\/explorer.msn.com\r\n","message_date":"January 29 2001 5:01 AM"}
