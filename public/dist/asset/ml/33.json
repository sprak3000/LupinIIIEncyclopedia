Strong \r\nart, dynamic staging and I cant read a word. I'm sure MANY of you know how \r\nfrustrating this is.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the most interesting thing about this issue was the catalog of Lupin \r\nmerchandise. There's some terrific stuff here and I'll describe it as well as \r\nI can, since I dont know a word of Japanese.\r\n\r\n-Lupin phonecards with Monkeypunch art\r\n-T-shirt with different Monkey Punch art\r\n-CD-Rom screensaver with Monkey Punch art\r\n-pen with Monkey Punch art\r\n-Medicom's newest Lupin figures- Stylish collection with Lupin, Jigen and \r\nGOEMON!\r\n-Medicom's set of Fujiko clothes for the Medicom Fujiko figure. All the \r\ncostumes are from first season. I thought this was a Medicom fan club \r\nexclusive- does anybody know if this is true or not?\r\n-large plush of Lupin and Fujiko\r\n-FANTASTIC statue(?) of our favorite group from Cagliostro. This looks really \r\ncool!\r\n-Lupin the Third- Jazz cd\r\nand..........\r\nLUPIN DVD's!!!!!\r\n\r\nOkay this it, the TV specials and feature films released on DVD, two every \r\nmonth. It starts with Hemmingway Papers and Goodbye Lady Liberty and went for \r\nsale on 12\/22\/99.\r\nThe next batch is released on January 21st. The next on 2\/21 and last is 3\/23.\r\n\r\nIt also lists complete videotape releases for Season One and Two of the TV \r\nseries.\r\n\r\nHere's my question- How do we get these!!!!!?????\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\nSteve","message_date":"February 2 2000 2:16 AM"}
