When DVDs first came out, I remember\r\nbeing promised so many languages on a disc.  Well, there's more people\r\nliving in Canada and the US other than English, French, and Spanish.  And\r\nanother thing, why does my DVD player come with 100 languages?  I mean,\r\nwhat's it for?  It's not that it can display menu items in those languages\r\n(like play, forward, etc). an dI'm sure it won't magically translate the\r\nsubtitles into the language of choice.  The player I have, if anyone wants\r\nto know, is Panasonic DV31 (or something like that. oops!).\r\n\r\nI wish we didn't have the stupid codes because I thought DVDs would rid of\r\nthe pal and ntsc incompatibilities.  So now it's that AND a code.","message_date":"January 30 2002 7:21 PM"}
