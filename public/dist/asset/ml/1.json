Paid $6.95 each for 'em.  I think they still have a \r\nset left, if anyone is interested.  If you're in NYC, it is Mondo Kim's on \r\nSt. Mark's (second floor is toys and LDs).\r\nWell, hope this helps.  Anyone else know any good source?  I'd give my \r\neyeteeth for a Medicom Claris figure!!!\r\n\r\n-Damaged\r\n-------------\r\nOriginal Text\r\nFrom: <vtcopr_at_pmrf@pmrf.navy.mil>, on 10\/27\/98 1:54 PM:\r\n     Is there any where out there that deal with Lupin merchandise?

I was just wondering what first got you \r\ninto Lupin, what your favorite Lupin Movie\/TV Special\/TV Ep is. What \r\nLupin stuff you've seen etc.\r\n    The first Lupin I saw was the Streamline release of Calgliostro\r\nCastle. After all the other Lupin things I have seen, that one is still \r\nmy favorite, yeah, it's not as gritty as some of the others but it is a \r\nhell of a lot of fun. Hell, it hooked me.\r\n    I've seen: Cagliostro, Wings of Albatross, Fuma Conspiracy, Dark\r\nOrder of Assasination, Zenbutsu Sword on Fire, Dead or Alive, and \r\nMystery of Mamo. My least favorite of those would have to be Mamo. It's \r\na damn shame because it started off really well, and had the best \r\ndialouge of any of them, but it was too far fetched even for Lupin. Dead \r\nor Alive is my favorite one visually, thougth the ending pretty much \r\nsucked.\r\n    So come on, I know you people are out there. What were your\r\nfavorites and why?\r\n--\r\n|  George Mori -- morig@cwtel.com                            | \r\n|  \"You can try anything you      \"He's the kind of kid that | \r\n|  like, but when I say I'll      has to get rid of stress   | \r\n|  kill you, your death is        or go into sexual crimes.\" | \r\n|  assured.\"                      --Maison Ikkoku            | \r\n|  --Kenshin, Ruroni Kenshin                                 | \r\n|        UnOfficial Tokyo University Story Homepage          | \r\n|  http:\/\/www.cwtel.com\/morig\/todai-index.htm          |\r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","message_date":"October 27 1998 1:59 PM"}
