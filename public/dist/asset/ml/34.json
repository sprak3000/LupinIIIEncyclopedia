{"id":"34","author":"bmmitch@bellsouth.net","subject":"need help","body":"\r\nThe mailing list has been kind of slow as of late, but now that we've gained\r\na few new people I've decided to ask for help. Does ANYONE know what\r\nmovie\/special the following cel is from? I bought this off of anime-cel.com\r\n(yeah, I collect cels, and specifically Lupin III ones when I can either\r\nfind or afford them) because a) it was a ten dollar cel of Lupin and b) HE'S\r\nWEARING GLASSES! I thought I could place it but I really have no idea. I\r\nhaven't seen a lot of the newer Lupin stuff (and my fansubs are taking\r\nforever to get here), so can anyone help me out? Maybe someone knows what\r\nthis is from. Would you tell me? Thanks. Here is the image (keep in mind the\r\npainted area is only 1\/4 of the cel area at the bottom right).\r\nhttp:\/\/members.tripod.com\/~poopybrown\/doclup.jpg\r\n\r\nArigato","message_date":"February 1 2000 5:39 PM"}
