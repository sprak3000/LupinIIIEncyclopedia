{"id":"161","author":"Arsene Lupin III","subject":"I got some Lupin games for Saturn.","body":"I got two Sega Saturn video games on Friday. Wanna\r\nknow what they are?\r\n\r\nLupin III: The Sage of Pyramid\r\n(Rupan Sansei: Piramiddo no Kenja)\r\n\r\nThe Lupin III Chronicles\r\n(T-8805G version)\r\n\r\nI have played both. The Lupin III Chronicles is not a\r\nvideo game, but is (as the box says in katakana) a\r\n\"data-tainment\" title. It has various bits and clips\r\nfrom series 1 and 2 and the 1st two anime films, as\r\nwell as a trivia game and a collection of scenes that\r\nhave special music in the background. It also has\r\nstill shots of important objects and characters from\r\nthe different episodes. There seem to be 3 versions:\r\nT-8804G\r\nT-8805G\r\nT-8806G\r\nI don't know how they are different, but they are\r\nsomehow.\r\n\r\nThe \"Lupin III: Sage of the Pyramid\" game is sort of\r\nlike a weird-control Tomb Raider, with a weird\r\npolygonal Lupin as your main character. There are a\r\nfew clips at the beginning that tell a bit of a story,\r\nbut the character design seems a bit off. This is\r\nespecially true when Lupin is hitting on some\r\nmysterious girl inside the pyramid, his face looks all\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\nAnyway, my thanks to Justin Buck from the Lupin ML, he\r\nlooked around overseas and shipped them to me. What a\r\nnice guy (of course, I had to pay him).\r\n\r\n\r\n=====\r\nTalesoftheWolf@Yahoo.com\r\n\"Lupin the Third\" Website: \r\nhttp:\/\/go.to\/lupin\r\n<or> http:\/\/talesofthewolf.homepage.com\r\n\r\n__________________________________________________\r\nDo You Yahoo!?\r\nSend instant messages & get email alerts with Yahoo!
