{"id":"157","author":"Noel Tominack, UCS Help Desk","subject":"Need holes in my Lupin knowledge filled","body":"Hi there.\r\n\r\nI was surfing all over the web looking at Lupin pages and could not find\r\nwhat I am looking for, so I thought I would ask the maintainer of the\r\nLupin III FAQ.\r\n\r\nJust what firearms does everyone use?\r\n\r\nLupin is easy--a Walther P.38 pistol.  In \"Lupin III:  The Mystery of the\r\nWalther P.38\" they have a close-up of it during the final battle and I\r\ncould make out the code \"AC 41\" on the slide--which is a WWII-era Walther\r\nmanufactured in 1941.  \r\n\r\nJigen is an interesting one, in the TV series he uses the phrase \"Combat\r\nMagnum\" which would put it in the Smith & Wesson \"K\"-frame family.  I \r\nhave never been able to get a firm grasp on the model number.  If you\r\nhappen to know its finish (blued or stainless) and rear sights (adjustable\r\nor fixed) I can narrow it down a bit.\r\n\r\nFujiko is a tough one.  In the TV series and some images it looks like she\r\nuses a FN\/Browning Model 1910 or 1922.  I am more inclined to beleive its\r\na 1910 based on the length of the slide.  In \"Cagliostro\" she uses a\r\nWWII-era Japanese military Type 14 Nambu pistol \r\n\r\nThe only other firearms I could readily itentify were the Count of\r\nCagliostro (with his Greman Mg13 Machine gun) and Jigen countering with\r\na Browning Automatic Rifle (I *think* its a BAR at least).\r\n\r\nAnyway, the curiousity is really getting to me\r\n\r\nNoel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n___________________________________________________________________________\r\n* Noel J.
