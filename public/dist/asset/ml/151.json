{"id":"151","author":"DANIEL ZELTER","subject":"I've found our Lupin!!","body":"Originally, I was considering Jet Li to be a good-enough Hong Kong actor to \r\nplay Lupin, but since his last two movies sucked, I finally found someone \r\nmore appropriate: Stephen Chow! (Or Chao for you purists.) If you've seen \r\n>From Beijing with Love \r\n(http:\/\/www.hkflix.com\/xq\/asp\/filmID.482\/qx\/details.htm ), he plays the \r\nPERFECT anti-Bond. (Which Lupin essentially is.) And if you've seen Shaolin \r\nSoccer[Get it from http:\/\/www.hkflix.com\/xq\/asp\/filmID.1316\/qx\/details.htm \r\nbefore Miramax ruins it.], Stephen proves he has enough chorepgraphy to make \r\na good action hero. Since Funimation has picked up Lupin, we don't need the \r\npetition anymore. But I think we need a new petition to get him to become \r\nthe actor to play the live-action Lupin. Anyone agree?\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\nMSN Photos is the easiest way to share and print your photos: \r\nhttp:\/\/photos.msn.com\/support\/worldwide.aspx\r\n","message_date":"January 17 2002 5:28 PM"}
