Luis is getting hitched and been working on \r\nthat...I on the other hand have projects, tests, work, and spotlight work \r\nI'm doing at my church's Christmas Pagent, so been busy with all those, but \r\nthe week before break starts for school I'm going to be in Florida, come \r\nback, then I'll have all the free tiem I want during break. Me and Luis are \r\nwhipping up something special for the page, just wanted to let you all know \r\nwe aren't dead. Also, as for my fanfic, looks like I hit a bad spot again \r\ntrying to figure out what to do. Not many people gave feedback on what they \r\nthought of the last two parts I wrote, surprised since so many emailed me \r\nbugging me to write more. :)\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nBruce Osborne\r\nEmail: saitoh-hajime@neo.rr.com\r\nICQ: 96064290\r\nBlue Sky Complex: www.thesoyokaze.net\/bluesky\r\nLEMONed Shrine: www.thesoyokaze.net\/lemoned\r\nLupin III Encyclopedia www.thesoyokaze.net\/lupinthe3rd","message_date":"December 10 2000 5:23 PM"}
