      "content": "<p>At long last, the Lupin PS2 game has arrived.  The general reaction most people have shared has boiled down to &quot;fun game, can be hard to control, and is bit short.&quot;  Unfortunately, the Doublejump game guide that was supposed to be released at the same time has yet to appear.  At some point close to zero hour, Doublejump announced that a deal was worked out with Bandai that would allow them to distribute the guide on the net for free.  Someone dropped the ball in a huge way though as this apparently requires lengthy negotiations with the Japanese licensor.  The guide has been promised &quot;ASAP&quot; but now appears to be more like &quot;ASAHFO&quot; (as soon as hell freezes over).</p>"

      "content": "Told you it would be a short newsletter.  All is quiet on the Lupin front these days.  There has been no word from Funimation regarding the release dates for <em>Dead or Alive</em> and <em>Nostradamus</em>.  All of the Japanese web sites (lupin-3rd.net, monkeypunch.com, etc.) have not had an update for months, though lupin-3rd.net claims to have updated, but I have yet to find any new content on the site.<p>Let's hope things pick up as the convention season starts in the next few months.    Until then, come chat with us every Tuesday and Thursday and keep up the chatter.  Cheers!</p>"
