Not only that, it is getting the full anamorphic treatment, will include the theatrical trailer, and will include an interview with the director.  It will hit the streets of Japan on 28 May for a retail price of 4800&yen;</p><p>With its release, the only title yet to have a DVD release will be <em>Trailers History</em>.  Can that title be too far behind?  Credit goes to &quot;ObiKenobi&quot; of the AoD forums for spotting the pre-order.</p>",
