      <p>This is an interactive manga issued by D2Manga and Daiki. The English language menu is accessed by choosing a chapter to play and then entering the options screen. You get to view four &quot;movies&quot; of Monkey Punch mangas: &quot;I Can't Stand It&quot;, &quot;Tooth for a Tooth&quot;, &quot;Hold Up&quot;, and &quot;180 Lupins&quot;. The controller allows you to pause, fast forward and rewind through each screen of the &quot;movie&quot;. Its really basic and totals about 20 - 30 minutes long. You can save the chapters and such on your memory card.</p>
