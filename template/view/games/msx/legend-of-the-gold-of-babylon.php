      <p>Pressing <strong>Up + B-button (GRAPH-key)</strong> will change your bubble ammunition. Special ammunition can be acquired by killing enemies. When you fall in the room with the flames, you must destroy the flames by shooting bubbles at them. When you hold out long enough you will get a reward and be bounced back up again. Items will pop up when you pass certain points or jump at the right places. Some of these will start a bonus game with Jigen or Goemon.</p>
