      <p>This is a pre-Nintendo era arcade game where you must avoid the security guards and a dog to steal all the money bags. The money bags are along the top of the screen; you can only carry two at a time.</p>
      <p>Carrying the bags slows you down a bit, and the guards speed up as you take more and more bags. Once you grab a money bag, you must take it to the deposit zone at the bottom center of the screen. Get caught by the guards or the dog, and its off to jail with you. Clear the level, and you take the money home to your sweetheart who promptly tells you to go steal more!</p>
