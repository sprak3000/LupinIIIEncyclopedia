        This was a <em>Dragon's Lair</em> clone that used footage from <em>The Castle of Cagliostro</em> and
        <em>The Mystery of Mamo</em>; only 550 machines (claim in doubt at this point) were made making the laserdisc
        from the game a rare collectible. Using the joystick and two action buttons, one for your hands and one for
        your feet, you made various choices of what Cliff (Lupin) should do as the action unfolds before you. Jumper
        settings inside the machine allowed on-screen hints to appear.
