                  The &quot;Pink Jacket&quot; series has seen little play outside of Japan and is chiefly judged by
                  <em><a href="/anime/theatrical-films/legend-of-the-gold-of-babylon" class="linked color-green">Legend of the Gold of Babylon</a></em>, the film produced during
                  the same time period. While <em>Babylon</em> and this series share the same comedy style, the third series
                  fares a bit better in its execution.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While no US distributor has released it on home video, the series was broadcasted by the digital television
                  station UTBHollywood in Southern California in 2010.  In September 2013, TMS stunned US fans by
                  streaming the third series on Hulu complete with subtitles. However, only thirty of the fifty episodes
                  were available at the time.

              <p>After narrowly escaping Zenigata, Lupin is both physically and mentally exhausted. However, he jumps at the chance to help Fujiko. Together, they attend a party of rich women located in an old castle, intent on stealing all their jewelry. Things take a turn for the worse when the castle tower they are in turns out to be a rocket ship that carries them all to an island nation at war. Zenigata is then called in to collect funds for the ransom of all the women as well as capture Lupin. When he gets there, he finds Lupin hanging from a cross, seconds away from being shot to death by Fujiko. It is all part of the plot designed by the mysterious Madam Razor.</p>

              <p>Will Zenigata rescue Lupin? If so, can Lupin figure exactly what the heck is going on? All this in an episode which makes absolutely no sense.</p>

              <p>In Central Park, Zenigata waits outside an armored car to ambush Lupin. Not to protect the money, but because Lupin is the prime suspect in the kidnapping of Madam Fiona. Lupin steals the money, eludes Zenigata, and delivers it to another party. It would seem he had been hypnotized by Fujiko to perform the task and is quickly knocked out with a monkey wrench. Zenigata arrests Lupin; and shortly afterward, Madam Fiona is set free claiming Lupin to be her kidnapper. Fujiko arrives at Madam Fiona's mansion expecting her cut of the profits only to find that Madam Fiona insists that she marry her bratty son, Roger. With the help of Goemon and Jigen, Lupin escapes prison.</p>

              <p>What's next on the &quot;To-Do&quot; list? Rescue Fujiko, get back the money, and restore his &quot;good&quot; name.</p>

              My preconceptions going into this series were based on <em><a href="/anime/theatrical-films/legend-of-the-gold-of-babylon" class="linked color-green">Legend of the
                  Gold of Babylon</a></em>; I was expecting an arduous journey through fifty episodes. However, this third TV
              series managed to be more entertaining, though not by much. Most of the episodes are mediocre heists lacking the
              wacky panache the second series mustered. The rest range from absurd slapstick to some of the hard edge the
              first series had. It was not an exceptional run of fifty episodes, but it managed to be just entertaining enough
              to keep me watching.
            </p>
            <p>
              With passable stories, one would hope that the animation and character designs would provide some decent eye
              candy to help. Not the case with the third series; the character designs are atrocious making the cast elongated,
              amorphous blobs. Fujiko comes off the worst looking like a hideous, old crone half the time. Near the end of the
              series, the characters edge back towards more familiar designs, but multiple animators must have been working on
              the series as they shift from the familiar back to the hideous for the last few episodes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Overall, this could have been much worse; I could not have sat through fifty episodes of material like
              <em>Babylon</em>. I managed to get some enjoyment out the series, but it is not one I will be pulling off the
              shelf much.
