                  After reruns made the first series a fan favorite, a second TV series was produced and set years after the
                  first series. Donning a red jacket, Lupin reunited with Jigen, Goemon, and Fujiko to resume their thieving
                  ways; this series retained the comic tone Miyazaki and Takahata brought to the close of the first series.
                  While the darker tones of the manga were left out, many of the manga stories were adapted into episodes.
                  The series also earns the distinction of being the first anime series to be broadcast in stereo starting
                  with episode 99 and intermittently to the end.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The &quot;Red Jacket&quot; series is the most recognizable and most popular series around the world. Episodes
                  145 and 155 are especially well known as Miyazaki Hayao returned to direct these episodes.

                  luxury liner Sirloin. But when Lupin appears, he tells them that he was invited by Fujiko. Why have they
                  received false invitations? Trapped aboard the ship with their eternal rival, Inspector Zenigata, a
                  confrontation with their bitter rival Mister X (the commissioner of Scorpion) is fast approaching!

                  <strong>Notes:</strong> This is a clear homage to the &quot;Pink Panther&quot; movies. &quot;Conaiseau&quot; is a pun on the Japanese pronunciation of &quot;Clouseau&quot;.

Another similar pun is the name of Conaiseau's assistant, Hageito, a takeoff on Cato, Clouseau's &quot;manservant&quot;.</p>

                <p>There are any number of repulsive things to eat, but Baron Gourmel wants to eat Lupin's fresh brain. The promise of his diamond collection to whoever delivers it is irresistible to Fujiko. With Jigen, who likes pork and beans, and Goemon, with his three-minute soba noodles, mixed in for good measure, how will the sublime pie-throwing showdown with the army of cooks come out? Is Lupin's cooking any good...?!</p>

                <p>One of Lupin's back teeth holds microfilm containing the location of Lupin I's grave. Using a nude operation, Fujiko takes it, teams up with Holmes III and three secret agents from the U.S., U.K., and the U.S.S.R., they take to the sky in a gigantic hot-air balloon. Lupin, Jigen, and Goemon fight their secret weapons, meant to eliminate interference, with the &quot;Live Capture&quot; technique(?!) taught to them the hard way by Zenigata. Where is the treasure? Who is the thief?</p>

                  <strong>Notes:</strong> Strictly speaking, this is the second appearance of Holmes III, who previously appeared in episode 15. However, the two differ in both appearance and voice and appear to have no connection other than name. This writer suspects a continuity gaffe occurred here, but nobody's perfect. The names of the three agents, &quot;Napoleon Zero (U.S.A),&quot; &quot;James Dobon (Great Britain),&quot; and &quot;Rasputan (U.S.S.R),&quot; are notable puns.</p>

                <p>Lupin and company took the complete take of a gambling casino, a little while ago. Boss Largo comes up with the most powerful group of killers in order to get it back. He hypnotizes a big-league baseball team, implanting a suggestion that they pitch and hit at Lupin, who has a toothache, whenever he puts his hand to his cheek. The pain of a cavity cannot be withstood. Is it game, set, and match when the opponents are pro-baseball players?!</p>

                <p>There is a reward of $1,000,000 for Lupin's arrest. This in itself is not unusual, but when a newspaper reports of Lupin's crimes before they happen, something is definitely not right. The way Old Lady Dokonjo, who publishes a small newspaper all by herself, figures it, scoops are the only way to increase sales. Lupin and company fall for her tearful pleas, but her son, Benson, is a sinister character. It's a motorcycle showdown!!</p>

                <p>Enraged at the hypocritical courtesy of English Lord Weather, Lupin accepts a bet over whether he can steal the Lord's horse, Red Arrow. Though he makes attempts while the horse is in transit, and during the hunt, the Lord's counterstrategies are scrupulous, leaving no opening. Lupin makes an impossible announcement: &quot;I will take the horse in the middle of the Grand National Race, before a full crowd in the stands!&quot; In a jumping accident, only the horse disappears?!</p>

                <p>Lupin and company are taking a summer vacation on Miami Beach. Suddenly, a helicopter appears in the sky overhead, its passenger shouting something about Lupin having placed a call saying that he was going to raid Miami Bank. After that comes a phone call asking them to raid the bank, adding the strange proviso that if they do, then Miami Bank will join the ranks of the country's best. So, Lupin agrees, for the moment. Though he takes a shot at cracking the vault, it turns out to be empty. The bank becomes very famous for not having had a single cent stolen. And they plan to hold an anniversary celebration next year on the same date?!</p>

With a heave, a pile of bills are laid before the sculptor, Vingel, by the mayor of a town who says he wants to make the mermaid into a tourist attraction, and Vingel sells it to him. When Fujiko cries to Lupin to get it back, he makes his entrance. The boxcar of the transport train carrying the statue has a special coupling mechanism, and stealing it will require a little engineering. Lupin's fanciful notion is a cold and clear one!</p>
