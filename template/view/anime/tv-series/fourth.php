                        Inspector Zenigata arrives in San Marino after receiving a note from Lupin The Third. This time,
                        instead of a declaration of a new theft, it's a wedding invitation. It seems Lupin is getting
                        married to Rebecca Rossellini, the young Chair of the Rossellini Zaibatsu. But behind the wedding
                        is Lupin's true goal: to steal San Marino's national treasure, the Royal Crown of Libertas.
                        Somehow, Zenigata receives a false note from someone who isn't Lupin, which clues him in to
                        Lupin's plan. Who sent him the note, and why?

                        An eerie old castle stands on the outskirts of Florence. It's been converted to a hotel, but
                        it's also known as the &quot;The Mansion of the Cursed Bride&quot;, where the ghost of a bride
                        is said to appear. It's said that a priceless treasure rests in the hotel, so Lupin and the gang
                        pay a visit. Jigen sees what he thinks is a ghost, but Lupin doesn't believe him and continues
                        searching for the treasure... then encounters a girl named Carla.

                        Long ago, a West African dictator was assassinated, and the assassins involved were later killed
                        one by one. Goemon was one of those involved in the assassination. A former bodyguard of the

                        with another assassin from the same case, Belladonna, to find him.
