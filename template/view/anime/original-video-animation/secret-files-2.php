                  The Lupin franchise has never been shy about trying to squeeze cash out of every available avenue &ndash; Exhibit A:
                  <em>The Secret Files 2 ~Sound Collection~</em>. For your money, you received a collection of all the opening
                  and closing sequences for the various TV series and the animated theatrical releases.  Also included are the
                  eye-catch sequences from the second TV series.  The most notable portion of this collection are the monaural
                  and stereo versions of the second series songs.  There is a significant difference between the two versions
                  as the stereo version adds in a lot more effects.

                  Beyond the initial VHS release, I have never seen this title released on laserdisc. It did find a new home in
                  the <em>LUPIN III Theatrical DVD LIMITED BOX</em> DVD set released on 2003 October 24.
