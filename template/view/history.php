          <h2>Kazuhiko Kato</h2>
          <div>(Summarized from a 2001 April 24 article in the Hokkaido Shimbun)</div>
          <p>Kazuhiko Kato was born in Kiritappu Village, Hamanaka, Hokkaido, Japan. His father would show him and his siblings cartoons on a projector and would scold him for spending money on candy. However, he was never scolded for buying manga.
          Ignoring his junior high school teacher's advice to become a teacher in the village, he would regularly submit cartoons to various newspapers and once one 500&yen; from the Hokkaido Shimbun.
          In the spring of 1953, he took a job at the Hamanaka branch of the Kushiro Red Cross Hospital and met the director Michishita Shunichi. Without this man's encouragment and recognition that he had a talent for drawing manga, Kazuhiko Kato may have never become &quot;Monkey Punch&quot;.</p>

          <h2>Lupin III debuts.</h2>
          Kazuhiko started his publishing career in 1965 with <em>Playboy School</em> (プレーボーイ入門) under the pen name Gamuta Eiji (がむた永二) and was currently writing <em>Pinky Punky</em> (ピンキィ パンキィ), when he was approached to
          do a three month project for a new magazine called <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weekly_Manga_Action" title="Wikipedia entry for Weekly Manga Action">Weekly Manga Action</a></em>. The editor suggested Kazuhiko use
          the pen name &quot;Monkey Punch&quot;; Kazuhiko reluctantly agreed to use it for a year. The three month project and one year pseudonym turned into a franchise that has spanned decades and a name that is still recognized in
          the anime and manga community.
