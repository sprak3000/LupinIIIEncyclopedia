                  With Fujiko, Jigen, and Goemon getting their own anime titles, it was inevitable that Zenigata would get
                  his own... live-action TV series?! NTV, WOWOW, and Hulu Japan are collaborating on the project with an
                  uknown 2017 debut date. NTV will show the main story, and WOWOW and Hulu Japan will show different
                  stories after the NTV airing.

                  There are no details about the rest of the Lupin gang showing up in the series. We do know that the
                  series revovles around investigating a mysterious explosion. Zenigata will be joined by two young
                  detectives. Natsuki Sakuraba follows in her father's footsteps by becoming a detective
                  at the Metropolitan Police Department CID Division 1. Her father died in the line of duty; one can
                  speculate this might converge as a plot point with the explosion investigation. Shintar&omacr; Kunikida is
                  also a detective whose failures to advance his career leads to self-doubt. The investigation will allow
                  him to learn from our favorite stubborn Inspector.
