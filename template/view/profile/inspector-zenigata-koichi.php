              <p>
                Zenigata Keibu (Keibu translates as &quot;Inspector&quot;) is an incredibly diligent yet incredibly
                gullible policeman whose life has been dedicated to bringing Lupin to justice. While he has some interest
                in capturing Jigen, Goemon, and Fujiko, he is really after only Lupin. Zenigata belongs to the esteemed
                ranks of law enforcers doomed to never successfully catch their man. Originally a member of the Tokyo
                Police Force, Zenigata was transferred to Interpol to allow him to travel the globe after Lupin. His
                obsession has unfortunately put a strain on his marriage and his relationship with his daughter Toshiko.

                Zenigata is based on a famous Japanese crime fighting character named Heiji Zenigata. The character is a
                few hundred years old and was best known for throwing coins as a weapon. Zenigata's handcuff throwing
                technique is his own take on the character's choice of weapon.
